# Costs: Terms, types and different theories

### 1. **Direct vs. Indirect Costs**

**Direct Costs:**

* These are costs that can be **directly traced to a specific product, service, or project**.
* Examples: raw materials, direct labor (workers producing a specific item), manufacturing supplies.

**Indirect Costs:**

* These are costs that **cannot be directly traced to a single product** but support overall operations.
* Examples: rent for the factory, utilities, administrative salaries, depreciation of equipment.

### 2. **Fixed vs. Variable Costs**

**Fixed Costs:**

* Costs that **remain constant regardless of production volume**.
* Examples: rent, salaries of administrative staff, insurance, depreciation.

**Variable Costs:**

* Costs that **change in direct proportion to production volume or activity level**.
* Examples: raw materials, production labor (if paid per unit), shipping costs, commissions.

### 3. **Combining the Classifications**

We can categorize costs in a **matrix**:

|                    | **Fixed**                                                                                                                                                  | **Variable**                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Direct Costs**   | Direct fixed: Costs tied to a product/project but fixed in amount. <br>Examples: specialized equipment for a product, salaried staff on a specific project | Direct variable: Costs tied to a product/project that vary with output. <br>Examples: raw materials, piece-rate labor                                                       |
| **Indirect Costs** | Indirect fixed: Costs not tied to a specific product and remain constant. <br>Examples: rent, utilities, office salaries                                   | Indirect variable: Costs not tied to a specific product but vary with overall production. <br>Examples: electricity in production, maintenance that scales with machine use |
