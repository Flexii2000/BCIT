# **1. Budget Types: Budgeted, Actual, and Standard**

## **Budgeted**

* The **planned** amount for revenue, costs, production, or performance.
* Represents what management *expects* or *intends* to happen.
* Used for setting targets and forecasting.

Examples:

* Budgeted sales of 10,000 units
* Budgeted labor cost of $20 per hour

---

## **Actual**

* The **real** results that occur.
* Used to compare against budgeted amounts to find variances.

Examples:

* Actual sales of 9,000 units
* Actual labor cost of $22 per hour

---

## **Standard**

* A **pre-set benchmark** for what a unit *should* cost or require under efficient conditions.
* Often used for **direct materials, direct labor, and overhead**.

Examples:

* Standard DM quantity: 3 kg per unit
* Standard labor rate: $18/hour
* Standard hours allowed per unit: 0.70 hours

Standards give a more precise basis for variance analysis than broad budgets.

# **2. Static vs. Flexible Budgets**

## **Static Budget**

* Based on **one level of activity** (e.g., 10,000 units).
* Does *not* adjust even if actual activity changes.
* Good for long-term planning but not for performance evaluation.

**Problem:**
If actual output differs from budgeted output, the static budget comparison becomes misleading.

---

## **Flexible Budget**

* Adjusts the **budgeted revenues and costs** to the **actual level of activity**.
* Shows what the budget *should have been* for the actual production level.
* Much more useful for performance evaluation.

Structure:

> **Flexible budget = (standard prices/costs) × (actual activity level)**

This removes the effect of volume differences and isolates operational performance.

# **3. Key Variance Types**

Variances measure the difference between **budgeted/standard** and **actual** results.

We break them into categories:

---

## **A. Rate Variance (also called “Price Variance”)**

Used for:

* Direct materials (DM price variance)
* Direct labor (DL rate variance)
* Variable overhead spending variance

Formula pattern:

> **(Actual Rate – Standard Rate) × Actual Quantity**

Interpretation:

* If actual rate is higher → **unfavorable**
* If actual rate is lower → **favorable**

Examples:

* Paying workers more or less per hour
* Paying more or less per kg of materials
* Overhead costs per hour higher/lower than expected

---

## **B. Efficiency Variance (also called “Usage Variance”)**

Used for:

* Direct materials (DM quantity variance)
* Direct labor (DL efficiency variance)
* Variable overhead efficiency variance

Formula pattern:

> **(Actual Quantity – Standard Quantity Allowed for Actual Output) × Standard Rate**

Interpretation:

* Using more input hours/units than expected → **unfavorable**
* Using fewer → **favorable**

Examples:

* More materials wasted in production
* Workers taking more time than standard
* Machines running inefficiently

---

## **C. Volume Variance**

Used for:

* **Fixed manufacturing overhead** only.

Formula:

> **Budgeted Fixed Overhead – Applied Fixed Overhead**

Or conceptually:

> **Difference caused by producing more or fewer units than planned.**

Interpretation:

* If actual production < budgeted → unfavorable (under-applied overhead)
* If actual production > budgeted → favorable (over-applied overhead)

This variance occurs because fixed overhead is spread across units.

---

## **D. Flexible-Budget Variance**

General performance measure.

Formula:

> **Actual Costs – Flexible Budget Costs**

OR (for revenue):

> **Actual Revenues – Flexible Budget Revenues**

Interpretation:

* Shows how well costs were controlled *at the actual level of activity*.
* Removes the distortion from volume differences.

| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| **Budgeted**                 | The planned amount                   | Used for targets and forecasting      |
| **Actual**                   | What really happened                 | Compared to budget for variances      |
| **Standard**                 | What inputs *should* cost or require | Basis for efficiency & rate variances |
| **Static Budget**            | Based on one activity level          | Doesn’t adjust for actual output      |
| **Flexible Budget**          | Adjusts to actual activity           | Best for evaluating performance       |
| **Rate Variance**            | Actual vs standard price/rate        | Price of input                        |
| **Efficiency Variance**      | Actual vs standard quantity used     | Usage of input                        |
| **Volume Variance**          | Created by output differences        | Fixed overhead only                   |
| **Flexible-Budget Variance** | Actual vs flexible budget            | True performance difference           |
