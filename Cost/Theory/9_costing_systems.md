# **1. Absorption Costing (Full Costing)**

### **What it is:**

Absorption costing is the method required by GAAP and IFRS for external financial reporting. It *absorbs* **all manufacturing costs** into the cost of a product.

### **What costs go into product cost?**

**Included (Product Costs):**

* Direct materials
* Direct labor
* Variable manufacturing overhead
* *Fixed* manufacturing overhead

**Excluded (Period Costs):**

* Selling & administrative expenses (both fixed and variable)

### **How it works:**

* Fixed manufacturing overhead is spread across each unit produced.
* If you produce more units than you sell, some fixed overhead gets stored in inventory instead of appearing on the income statement.

### **Why it matters:**

* Income can increase just by producing more units, even if they aren’t sold (because more fixed overhead goes into inventory).
* Required for external financial statements.

# **2. Variable Costing (Direct or Marginal Costing)**

### **What it is:**

Variable costing includes *only variable manufacturing costs* in product cost. Fixed manufacturing overhead is treated as a **period expense**.

### **What costs go into product cost?**

**Included (Product Costs):**

* Direct materials
* Direct labor
* Variable manufacturing overhead

**Excluded from product cost (expensed immediately):**

* *Fixed* manufacturing overhead
* Selling & administrative expenses

### **How it works:**

* Fixed manufacturing overhead is not tied to inventory.
* Profit depends entirely on *sales volume*, not production volume.

### **Why it matters:**

* Great for internal decision-making.
* Avoids the issue where managers overproduce to inflate profit.
* Contribution margin (Sales – Variable Costs) is easy to compute for analysis.

# **3. Throughput Costing (Super-Variable Costing / Theory of Constraints)**

### **What it is:**

Throughput costing is the most restrictive form of product costing. It is used in **Theory of Constraints (TOC)** and focuses on maximizing flow through the bottleneck.

### **What costs go into product cost?**

**Included (Product Cost):**

* Direct materials only

**Everything else is a period expense:**

* Direct labor
* Variable manufacturing overhead
* Fixed manufacturing overhead
* Selling & administrative expenses

### **Why?**

TOC views labor and overhead as mostly fixed in the short run. The real variable cost of producing another unit is usually *only the material cost*.

### **Why it matters:**

* Helps identify what products maximize throughput at the bottleneck.
* Emphasizes speed and flow, not inventory buildup.
* Useful for operations-focused decision making.

# **Quick Comparison Table**

| Costing Method | DM      | DL | Var MOH | **Fixed MOH**    | Best Use                    |
| -------------- | ------- | -- | ------- | ---------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Absorption** | ✔️      | ✔️ | ✔️      | ✔️ Product cost  | External reporting; GAAP    |
| **Variable**   | ✔️      | ✔️ | ✔️      | ❌ Period expense | Internal decision-making    |
| **Throughput** | ✔️ Only | ❌  | ❌       | ❌                | Bottleneck management (TOC) |

# **Easy Way to Remember**

* **Absorption = All manufacturing costs absorbed.**
* **Variable = Only variable manufacturing costs go into inventory.**
* **Throughput = Only the cost that *truly varies* with each unit — direct materials.**
