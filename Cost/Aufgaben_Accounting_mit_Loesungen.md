## Chapter 2 – Cost Behavior & Inventory Flow Formulas

### 1. Total Cost Structure
$Total\ Cost = Fixed\ Costs + (Variable\ Cost\ per\ Unit \times Q)$  
or  
$TC = F + V_u \times Q$

---

### 2. Cost per Unit
$Unit\ Cost = \dfrac{Total\ Cost}{Units\ Produced}$  
$Unit\ Variable\ Cost = \dfrac{Total\ Variable\ Cost}{Units}$

---

### 3. Direct Materials Used
$DM_{used} = DM_{beginning} + Purchases - DM_{ending}$

---

### 4. Manufacturing Overhead (MOH)
$MOH = Indirect\ Materials + Indirect\ Labour + Plant\ Costs + Depreciation + Utilities + Other\ Indirects$

---

### 5. Total Manufacturing Costs
$Total\ Manufacturing\ Costs = DM_{used} + DL + MOH$

---

### 6. Cost of Goods Manufactured (COGM)
$COGM = Total\ Manufacturing\ Costs + WIP_{beginning} - WIP_{ending}$

---

### 7. Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)
$COGS = COGM + FG_{beginning} - FG_{ending}$

---

### 8. Cost of Goods Purchased (Merchandising)
$Cost\ of\ Goods\ Purchased = Purchases + Freight\text{-}in - Returns - Discounts$

---

### 9. Cost of Sales
$Cost\ of\ Sales = Beginning\ Inventory + Cost\ of\ Goods\ Purchased - Ending\ Inventory$

---

### 10. Inventory Relationships
$DM_{end} = DM_{begin} + Purchases - DM_{used}$  
$WIP_{end} = WIP_{begin} + Total\ Costs\ Incurred - COGM$  
$FG_{end} = FG_{begin} + COGM - COGS$

---

### 11. Mixed and Fixed Cost Relationships
$y = a + bX$  
(where $a$ = fixed cost, $b$ = variable cost per unit, $X$ = activity level)

---

## Chapter 3 – CVP & Operating Leverage Formulas

### 12. Basic Contribution Margin Formulas
$CM_{unit} = P - V$  
$CM_{total} = (P - V) \times Q$

---

### 13. Fixed Cost and Break-Even
$BEP_{units} = \dfrac{F}{CM_{unit}}$  
$BEP_{sales} = BEP_{units} \times P$

---

### 14. Target Profit (Before Taxes)
If target operating income is given:  
$Q = \dfrac{F + Target\ Operating\ Income}{CM_{unit}}$

If target net income (after tax) is given:  
$Target\ Operating\ Income = \dfrac{Target\ Net\ Income}{1 - Tax\ Rate}$  

Then:  
$Q = \dfrac{F + Target\ Operating\ Income}{CM_{unit}}$

---

### 15. Contribution Margin Income Statement
$Revenue = P \times Q$  
$Variable\ Costs = V_{unit} \times Q$  
$Contribution\ Margin = Revenue - Variable\ Costs$  
$Operating\ Income = Contribution\ Margin - F$

---

### 16. Commission and Multi-Revenue Adjustments
If revenue is commission-based:  
$P_{effective} = P_{ticket} \times Commission\ Rate$  

If revenue has multiple components (e.g., fee + commission):  
$P_{effective} = P_{commission} + P_{fee}$  
$V_{effective} = V_{ticket} + V_{fee}$

If a cost is a % of revenue:  
$V_{effective} = V + (Commission\% \times P)$

---

### 17. Operating Leverage and Mixed Cost Structure
$Operating\ Income = (P - V) \times Q - F$  

$BEP_{units} = \dfrac{F}{P - V}$  

$DOL = \dfrac{CM}{Operating\ Income} = \dfrac{(P - V) \times Q}{(P - V) \times Q - F}$

---

### 18. Margin of Safety (MOS)
$MOS_{units} = Actual\ Sales\ Units - BEP_{units}$  
$MOS_{ratio} = \dfrac{Actual\ Sales - BE\ Sales}{Actual\ Sales}$  
or equivalently  
$MOS\% = 1 - \dfrac{BE\ Units}{Actual\ Units}$

---

### 19. Multi-Product CVP Analysis
$WACM = \dfrac{\sum (CM_i \times Mix_i)}{\sum Mix_i}$  
$BEP_{composite} = \dfrac{F}{WACM}$  
$BEP_i = BEP_{composite} \times Mix_i$  
$BEP_{sales} = \sum (BEP_i \times P_i)$

---

##  Chapter 4 – Job Costing & Overhead Formulas

### 20. Total Job Cost
$Job\ Cost = DM + DL + Applied\ OH$

---

### 21. Overhead Rate (Normal Costing)
$Predetermined\ OH\ Rate = \dfrac{Budgeted\ OH}{Budgeted\ Allocation\ Base}$

---

### 22. Overhead Rate (Actual Costing)
$Actual\ OH\ Rate = \dfrac{Actual\ OH}{Actual\ Allocation\ Base}$

---

### 23. Applied Overhead
$Applied\ OH = Predetermined\ Rate \times Actual\ Base\ Usage$

---

### 24. Over/Underapplied Overhead
$Over/Under\ Applied = Applied\ OH - Actual\ OH$  

- If $Applied > Actual \Rightarrow$ Overapplied  
- If $Applied < Actual \Rightarrow$ Underapplied

---

### 25. Adjusted Cost of Goods Sold
$Adjusted\ COGS = Unadjusted\ COGS \pm (Over/Under\ Applied\ OH)$  

- Overapplied → subtract  
- Underapplied → add

---

### 26. Proration of Over/Underapplied MOH
$Allocation_{account} = \dfrac{Applied\ OH_{account}}{Total\ Applied\ OH} \times Adjustment$

---

### 27. Departmental Overhead Rate
$Dept\ OH\ Rate = \dfrac{Budgeted\ OH_{dept}}{Budgeted\ Base_{dept}}$

---

### 28. Direct Cost Rate per Labour Hour
$Direct\ Rate = \dfrac{Total\ Direct\ Costs}{Total\ Direct\ Labour\ Hours}$

---

### 29. Indirect (Support) Cost Rate per Labour Hour
$Indirect\ Rate = \dfrac{Total\ Indirect\ Costs}{Total\ Direct\ Labour\ Hours}$

---

### 30. Normal vs. Actual Costing Summary
| Method | Direct Costs | Indirect Costs (OH) |
|---------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Actual Costing** | Actual rate | Actual rate |

### Relevant Range and Cost Behavior (2-23)

**Given data**

- Machine capacity = 5,000 jaw-breakers/month  
- Current production = 3,000/month  
- Material cost = $0.10 per jaw-breaker  
- Fixed costs:  
  - Machine depreciation = $6,000 ÷ 10 years = $600/year → $50/month  
  - Rent & other overhead = $1,000/month  
  → **Total fixed cost = $1,050/month = $12,600/year**

Next year:  
- Demand expected to double (100% increase → 6,000/month)  
- At that level, material price drops 10% → $0.09 per jaw-breaker  
- Fixed costs remain the same.

---

#### 1) Current annual relevant range of output

Machine capacity = 5,000 × 12 = **60,000 jaw-breakers per year**

Current production = 3,000 × 12 = 36,000 per year  
→ Relevant range (machine’s effective operating capacity) = **0 to 60,000 jaw-breakers per year**

---

#### 2) Current annual fixed and variable manufacturing costs

- **Fixed manufacturing cost:**  
  $12,600 per year (machine depreciation + rent + other OH)

- **Variable manufacturing cost:**  
  $0.10 per unit × 36,000 units = $3,600  
  → Variable rate = **$0.10 per jaw-breaker**

**Total cost (current level):** $12,600 + $3,600 = **$16,200**

---

#### 3) Next year’s relevant range and cost changes

- **New relevant range:** demand doubles → 6,000 × 12 = 72,000 units/year  
  However, machine capacity = 60,000/year → still limited to **60,000 jaw-breakers/year**

- **Fixed costs:** remain constant at $12,600/year.  
- **Variable costs:** new material cost = $0.09 per unit (10% discount).

If production expands to full capacity (60,000 units):  
Variable cost = 60,000 × $0.09 = $5,400  
**Total cost next year = 12,600 + 5,400 = $18,000**

---

#### Summary

| Year | Output Range (units/year) | Variable Cost/unit | Annual Fixed Cost | Max Total Cost (at capacity) |
|------|----------------------------|--------------------|-------------------|------------------------------|
| Current | 0–60,000 | $0.10 | $12,600 | $18,600 |
| Next Year | 0–60,000 | $0.09 | $12,600 | $18,000 |

### 2-29 Comprehensive Problem on Unit Costs and Product Costs  

---

#### 1) Direct Materials Inventory (Dec 31 2025)
Each unit uses **2 kg** of material.  
→ For 100 000 units, **200 000 kg used**.  
Direct materials cost = $140 000 → $0.70 per kg.  

Ending inventory = 2 000 kg × $0.70 = **$1 400**.

---

#### 2) Manufacturing Costs for 100 000 Units

| Cost Category | Variable | Fixed | Total |
|----------------|-----------|--------|--------|
| Direct materials | $140 000 | – | $140 000 |
| Direct manuf. labour | 30 000 | – | 30 000 |
| Plant energy | 5 000 | – | 5 000 |
| Indirect manuf. labour | 10 000 | 16 000 | 26 000 |
| Other indirect manuf. | 8 000 | 24 000 | 32 000 |
| **Totals** | **$193 000** | **$40 000** | **$233 000** |

**Cost of goods manufactured = $233 000**  
Average unit manufacturing cost = $233 000 ÷ 100 000 = **$2.33 per unit**.  

Finished goods (ending inventory $20 970) → $20 970 ÷ $2.33 ≈ **9 000 units**.

---

#### 3) Selling Price per Unit (2025)

Units sold = 100 000 − 9 000 = 91 000 units.  
Revenue = $436 800 ÷ 91 000 = **$4.80 per unit**.

---

#### 4) Operating Income for 2025

| Item | Amount |
|-------|--------:|
| Revenue (91 000 × $4.80) | $436 800 |
| Cost of goods sold = $233 000 − 20 970 | 212 030 |
| **Gross margin** | **224 770** |
| Variable mktg./distn./cust-serv costs | 122 850 |
| Fixed mktg./distn./cust-serv costs | 40 000 |
| Admin costs | 50 000 |
| **Operating income** | **$11 920** |

---

**Final Answers**

| Required | Answer |
|-----------|---------:|
| 1. Direct materials inventory | $1 400 |
| 2. Finished goods (units) | 9 000 units |
| 3. Selling price per unit | $4.80 |

**Step 1 – Compute CM per unit**  
CM per unit = $P - V = 30{,}000 - 24{,}000 = 6{,}000$  
Each car sold contributes \$6,000 toward covering fixed costs and profit.

**Step 2 – Compute BEP in units**  
BEP = $\frac{162{,}000}{6{,}000} = 27$ cars  
At 27 cars, total contribution margin equals total fixed costs.

**Explanation:**  
At this level, the business neither makes a profit nor a loss — all fixed costs are exactly covered.  
If fewer than 27 cars are sold, the company operates at a loss; any additional cars create profit.

---

##### 2) Target monthly net income = $72{,}000$

**Step 1 – Convert target net income to operating income**  
Target Operating Income = $\frac{72{,}000}{1 - 0.40} = 120{,}000$  
Since taxes reduce profit by 40%, the business must earn \$120,000 before taxes to keep \$72,000 after tax.

**Step 2 – Compute required sales volume**  
Required units = $\frac{162{,}000 + 120{,}000}{6{,}000} = 47$ cars

**Explanation:**  
The company must sell 47 cars to cover both fixed costs (\$162,000) and the desired after-tax income.  
Selling 47 cars yields enough contribution margin (\$282,000) to provide an operating income of \$120,000,  
which results in a net income of \$72,000 after accounting for taxes.

![3-13](/images/accounting/3-15.jpeg)

#### 1) Prepare last year’s profit report (Contribution-Margin Format)

**Given:**
- Ticket price per attendee = $20$  
- Attendance = $500$  
- Cost of dinner: $6,000$ fixed, $5,000$ variable  
- Invitations & paperwork: $2,500$ fixed, $500$ variable  

---

**Step 1 – Compute revenue and total variable costs**  
Revenue = $20 \times 500 = 10,000$  
Total variable costs = $5,000 + 500 = 5,500$

---

**Step 2 – Compute contribution margin**  
Contribution Margin = $10,000 - 5,500 = 4,500$

---

**Step 3 – Compute fixed costs and operating loss**  
Total fixed costs = $6,000 + 2,500 = 8,500$  
Operating Income (Loss) = $4,500 - 8,500 = -4,000$

---

**Contribution-Margin Income Statement (Last Year)**

| Item | Amount ($) |
|------|-------------|
| Revenue (500 × 20) | 10,000 |
| Variable Costs | (5,500) |
| **Contribution Margin** | **4,500** |
| Fixed Costs | (8,500) |
| **Operating Income (Loss)** | **(4,000)** |

**Explanation:**  
Last year, the event ran at a \$4,000 loss because total fixed costs exceeded the contribution margin.  
Each attendee contributed \$9 ($\$20 - \$11$) toward covering fixed costs, but it wasn’t sufficient to break even.

---

#### 2) Attendance expected to double

**New attendance:** $1,000$ attendees  
Revenue = $20 \times 1,000 = 20,000$  
Variable Costs = $(5,000 + 500) \times 2 = 11,000$  
Fixed Costs remain = $8,500$

---

**Step 1 – Compute new contribution margin**  
Contribution Margin = $20,000 - 11,000 = 9,000$

---

**Step 2 – Compute new operating income**  
Operating Income = $9,000 - 8,500 = 500$

---

**Contribution-Margin Income Statement (Expanded Attendance)**

| Item | Amount ($) |
|------|-------------|
| Revenue (1,000 × 20) | 20,000 |
| Variable Costs | (11,000) |
| **Contribution Margin** | **9,000** |
| Fixed Costs | (8,500) |
| **Operating Income (Profit)** | **500** |

**Explanation:**  
Doubling attendance increases total contribution margin enough to cover fixed costs and produce a $500 profit.  
The event moves from a $4,000 loss to a small surplus, making the expansion financially beneficial.

## 3-17-Sunshine-Tours
[Table of Contents](#Table-of-Contents)

![3-13](/images/accounting/3-17.jpeg)

### Sunshine Tours – Required Calculations

**Given:**  
- $Fixed\ Costs = 22{,}000$ per month  
- Target operating income = $10{,}000$  
- Carib ticket price = $1{,}000$

---

#### Case 1
**Variable cost:** $35$ per ticket  
**Commission:** 8 % of $1{,}000$ = $80$ revenue per ticket  

CM per unit = $80 - 35 = 45$  

Break-even units = $\frac{22{,}000}{45} = 489$ tickets  
Target income units = $\frac{22{,}000 + 10{,}000}{45} = 712$ tickets  

**Comment:** Profitability depends strongly on the commission rate. A small 8 % margin requires high ticket volume.

---

#### Case 2
**Variable cost:** $29$ per ticket  
**Commission:** 8 % of $1{,}000$ = $80$  

CM per unit = $80 - 29 = 51$  

Break-even units = $\frac{22{,}000}{51} = 432$ tickets  
Target income units = $\frac{22{,}000 + 10{,}000}{51} = 628$ tickets  

**Comment:** Lower variable cost increases CM by \$6 per ticket and lowers the break-even point.

---

#### Case 3
**Variable cost:** $29$ per ticket  
**Commission:** fixed \$48 per ticket revenue  

CM per unit = $48 - 29 = 19$  

Break-even units = $\frac{22{,}000}{19} = 1{,}158$ tickets  
Target income units = $\frac{22{,}000 + 10{,}000}{19} = 1{,}685$ tickets  

**Comment:** A fixed \$48 commission reduces unit profitability sharply; volume must nearly triple compared to Case 2 to reach break-even.

---

#### Case 4
**Variable cost:** $29$ per ticket + \$2 delivery cost = $31$  
**Revenue:** \$48 commission + \$12 delivery fee = \$60  

CM per unit = $60 - 31 = 29$  

Break-even units = $\frac{22{,}000}{29} = 759$ tickets  
Target income units = $\frac{22{,}000 + 10{,}000}{29} = 1{,}104$ tickets  

**Comment:** Adding a delivery fee raises revenue and contribution margin, reducing the required sales volume compared with Case 3.

---

**Summary Table**

| Case | Revenue/Unit | Variable Cost/Unit | CM per Unit | BE (units) | Target (10k) units |
|------|---------------|-------------------|--------------|-------------|--------------------|
| 1 | 80 | 35 | 45 | 489 | 711 |
| 2 | 80 | 29 | 51 | 431 | 627 |
| 3 | 48 | 29 | 19 | 1,158 | 1,684 |
| 4 | 60 | 31 | 29 | 759 | 1,103 |

**Interpretation:**  
Reducing variable costs or adding new revenue components (like delivery fees) improves contribution margin and decreases the break-even and target-income requirements.

## 3-21-Cover-Rugs-Operating-Leverage
[Table of Contents](#Table-of-Contents)

![3-13](/images/accounting/3-21.jpeg)

### Cover Rugs – Operating Leverage Analysis

**Given:**
- Selling price $P = 950$
- Purchase cost $V = 760$
- Option 1: Fixed payment $F = 7{,}410$
- Option 2: 10% of revenue (treated as variable cost addition of $0.10 \times 950 = 95$ per unit)
- No other costs

---

#### 1) Breakeven point (units)

**Option 1:**  
CM per unit = $P - V = 950 - 760 = 190$  
BEP = $\frac{F}{CM} = \frac{7{,}410}{190} = 39$ units

**Option 2:**  
Effective variable cost = $V + (0.10 \times P) = 760 + 95 = 855$  
CM per unit = $950 - 855 = 95$  
No fixed cost, so BEP = $\frac{0}{95} = 0$ units  

**Interpretation:**  
Option 1 requires at least 39 sales to cover fixed cost.  
Option 2 has no fixed cost and therefore breaks even immediately.

---

#### 2) Equal operating income point

Operating income Option 1 = $(190 \times Q) - 7{,}410$  
Operating income Option 2 = $95 \times Q$  

Set equal:  
$190Q - 7{,}410 = 95Q$  
$95Q = 7{,}410$  
$Q = 78$ units  

**Interpretation:**  
At 78 sales, both options yield the same operating income.  

a) Option 1 preferred for $Q > 78$ (higher CM per unit)  
b) Option 2 preferred for $Q < 78$ (no fixed cost, safer at low sales)

---

#### 3) Degree of Operating Leverage at 65 units

**Option 1:**

Operating income = $(190 \times 65) - 7{,}410 = 12{,}350 - 7{,}410 = 4{,}940$  
Total CM = $190 \times 65 = 12{,}350$  
$DOL = \frac{CM}{Operating\ Income} = \frac{12{,}350}{4{,}940} = 2.5$

**Option 2:**

Operating income = $95 \times 65 = 6{,}175$  
Total CM = $6{,}175$  
$DOL = \frac{6{,}175}{6{,}175} = 1.0$

---

#### 4) Interpretation

- Option 1 shows higher **operating leverage (2.5)**, meaning profit is more sensitive to changes in sales volume.  
- Option 2 shows **DOL = 1**, meaning profits change proportionally with sales.  
- At low sales volumes, Option 2 minimizes risk due to no fixed cost.  
- At higher volumes, Option 1 provides greater profit potential per unit sold.

## 3-23-Marketing-Docs-Margin-of-Safety
[Table of Contents](#Table-of-Contents)

![3-23](/images/accounting/3-23.jpeg)

### Marketing Docs – Margin of Safety and CVP Analysis

**Given:**
- Budgeted revenue = $1{,}500{,}000$
- Planned sales = $500$ marketing plans
- Selling price per plan $P = 3{,}000$
- Variable cost per plan $V = 2{,}000$
- Fixed costs $F = 400{,}000$
- Target margin of safety = 45%

---

#### 1) Breakeven and margin of safety (current situation)

CM per plan = $P - V = 3{,}000 - 2{,}000 = 1{,}000$

Break-even units = $\frac{F}{CM_{unit}} = \frac{400{,}000}{1{,}000} = 400$ plans  

Margin of Safety (units) = $500 - 400 = 100$  
Margin of Safety (%) = $\frac{100}{500} = 20\%$

**Result:**  
Current MOS = 20%, below the desired 45%.

---

#### 2) Evaluate possible changes

##### a) Increase price to $4{,}000$

New CM = $4{,}000 - 2{,}000 = 2{,}000$  
BEP = $\frac{400{,}000}{2{,}000} = 200$ plans  
MOS = $500 - 200 = 300$  
MOS% = $\frac{300}{500} = 60\%$

**Effect:** Achieves target (MOS 60% > 45%).  

---

##### b) Increase number of plans by 5%

New sales = $500 \times 1.05 = 525$  
BEP unchanged at $400$  
MOS = $525 - 400 = 125$  
MOS% = $\frac{125}{525} = 24\%$

**Effect:** Improvement, but still below 45%.

---

##### c) New software: +5% fixed cost, −10% variable cost

New fixed cost = $400{,}000 \times 1.05 = 420{,}000$  
New variable cost = $2{,}000 \times 0.90 = 1{,}800$  
New CM = $3{,}000 - 1{,}800 = 1{,}200$  
BEP = $\frac{420{,}000}{1{,}200} = 350$  
MOS = $500 - 350 = 150$  
MOS% = $\frac{150}{500} = 30\%$

**Effect:** Improves margin of safety (30%), but still below target.

---

**Summary Table**

| Scenario | CM per Plan | BEP (units) | MOS (units) | MOS (%) | Achieves 45%? |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|--------------|----------|----------------|
| Base | 1,000 | 400 | 100 | 20% | No |
| a) Price ↑ | 2,000 | 200 | 300 | 60% | Yes |
| b) Volume ↑ | 1,000 | 400 | 125 | 24% | No |
| c) New software | 1,200 | 350 | 150 | 30% | No |

---

**Conclusion:**  
Only increasing the average selling price to \$4,000 per plan achieves the desired **margin of safety ≥ 45%**.  
The other options improve performance but remain below the target threshold.

## 3-28-Classical-Glasses-Alternative-Cost-Structures
[Table of Contents](#Table-of-Contents)

![3-28](/images/accounting/3-28.jpeg)

### Classical Glasses – Alternative Cost Structures

**Given:**
- Selling price per pair $P = 30$
- Variable cost per pair $V = 10$
- Rent = $1{,}000$ per month
- Two employees: $2 × 160 × 10 = 3{,}200$ per month
- Manager salary & benefits: $(60{,}000 + 12{,}000) × 0.5 = 36{,}000$ per year → $3{,}000$ per month  
- Total fixed costs $F = 1{,}000 + 3{,}200 + 3{,}000 = 7{,}200$

---

#### 1) Break-even units
CM per unit = $P - V = 30 - 10 = 20$  
BEP = $\frac{F}{CM_{unit}} = \frac{7{,}200}{20} = 360$ sunglasses  

**Explanation:**  
The kiosk must sell **360 pairs per month** to cover all fixed costs.

---

#### 2) Target operating income = $5{,}300$
Required units = $\frac{F + Target\ OI}{CM_{unit}} = \frac{7{,}200 + 5{,}300}{20} = 625$ sunglasses  

**Explanation:**  
To earn $5,300$ profit, the kiosk must sell **625 pairs per month**.

---

#### 3) Employees switch to 15 % sales-commission pay
Commission = $15\% \times 30 = 4.50$ per pair  
New variable cost = $10 + 4.50 = 14.50$  
New CM per unit = $30 - 14.50 = 15.50$  
New fixed cost (rent + manager) = $1{,}000 + 3{,}000 = 4{,}000$

Required units = $\frac{4{,}000 + 5{,}300}{15.50} = 600$ sunglasses  

**Explanation:**  
With commission-based pay, the break-even level decreases slightly (600 vs 625) because fixed payroll costs fall.

---

#### 4) Replace fixed rent with 10 % of revenue
Rent % = 10 % × $30 = 3$ per pair  
New variable cost = $10 + 3 = 13$  
New CM = $30 - 13 = 17$  
Fixed costs now = $3{,}200 + 3{,}000 = 6{,}200$

Find indifference point (equal profit):

$20Q - 7{,}200 = 17Q - 6{,}200$  
$3Q = 1{,}000 \Rightarrow Q = 333$ sunglasses  

**Interpretation:**  
- Below **333 units**, the 10 % revenue rent (Option 2) is cheaper because less fixed cost.  
- Above **333 units**, the fixed rent (Option 1) yields higher profit due to higher contribution margin.

---

**Summary Table**

| Scenario | CM/unit | Fixed Cost | BE (units) | Target (5.3 k) units | Preferred when |
|-----------|----------|-------------|-------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Base (hourly + fixed rent) | 20.00 | 7,200 | 360 | 625 | — |
| 15 % commission | 15.50 | 4,000 | 258 | 600 | Moderate sales |
| 10 % rent | 17.00 | 6,200 | 365 | 670 | Low sales < 333 → % rent; High sales > 333 → fixed rent |

---

**Conclusion:**  
Commission-based pay and percentage rent lower fixed costs but increase variable cost.  
Fixed rent and hourly pay produce higher profit once sales volume exceeds about 333 units.

## 3-33-Crystal-Clear-Products-Multi-Product-CVP
[Table of Contents](#Table-of-Contents)

![3-33](/images/accounting/3-33.jpeg)


### Crystal Clear Products – Multi-Product CVP Analysis

**Given:**
- Faucet unit: $P = 90$, $V = 25$, $CM = 65$  
- Pitcher unit: $P = 110$, $V = 20$, $CM = 90$  
- Sales mix = 2 Faucets : 3 Pitchers  
- Fixed costs = $1{,}200{,}000$

---

#### 1) Breakeven point (current mix)

**Step 1 – Compute weighted-average CM (WACM):**

$WACM = \frac{(65×2) + (90×3)}{2 + 3} = \frac{130 + 270}{5} = 80$ per composite unit

Each composite unit = 2 Faucets + 3 Pitchers

**Step 2 – Breakeven in composite units:**

$BEP_{composite} = \frac{1{,}200{,}000}{80} = 15{,}000$ composite units

**Step 3 – Breakeven for each product:**

Faucets = $15{,}000×\frac{2}{5} = 6000$units  
Pitchers = $16{,}000×\frac{3}{5} = 9000$ units

**Step 4 – Breakeven in dollars:**

Sales value per composite = $(90×2) + (110×3) = 510$  
Total breakeven sales = $15{,}000 × 510 = 7{,}650{,}000$

**Result:**  
$BEP = 30{,}000$ Faucets and $45{,}000$ Pitchers ($7.65M total sales).

---

#### 2) New equipment scenario

Changes:  
- Fixed cost increases by $208{,}000 → 1{,}408{,}000$  
- New variable costs: Faucet $20$, Pitcher $10$  
  → New CMs = Faucet $70$, Pitcher $100$

**Step 1 – New WACM:**

$WACM = \frac{(70×2) + (100×3)}{5} = \frac{140 + 300}{5} = 88$

**Step 2 – New BEP composite:**

$BEP_{composite} = \frac{1{,}408{,}000}{88} = 16{,}000$ composite units

**Step 3 – Per product:**

Faucets = $16{,}000×\frac{2}{5} = 6400$  
Pitchers = $16{,}000×\frac{3}{5} = 9600$

**Result:**  
With new equipment, breakeven rises slightly (total 80,000 units vs. 75,000).

---

#### 3) Indifference sales level (old vs. new)

Let $Q_c$ = composite units for indifference.  
Old: $80Q_c - 1{,}200{,}000$  
New: $88Q_c - 1{,}408{,}000$

Set equal:  
$80Q_c - 1{,}200{,}000 = 88Q_c - 1{,}408{,}000$  
$8Q_c = 208{,}000$  
$Q_c = 26{,}000$ composite units

**Interpretation:**  
At 26,000 composite units (2 Faucets + 3 Pitchers = 130,000 total units), both yield same income.

**Step 4 – Evaluate given 24,000 total units**

Current total = 24,000 units overall.  
Since 24,000 < 130,000 equivalent, sales are below the indifference point →  
**Keep old equipment**, as new fixed cost increase outweighs savings.

---

**Summary Table**

| Scenario | CM Faucet | CM Pitcher | WACM | Fixed Cost | BEP Composite | Faucet Units | Pitcher Units | Decision |
|-----------|-----------|------------|------|-------------|----------------|---------------|----------------|-----------|
| Old | 65 | 90 | 80 | 1,200,000 | 15,000 | 30,000 | 45,000 | — |
| New | 70 | 100 | 88 | 1,408,000 | 16,000 | 32,000 | 48,000 | Higher BEP |
| Indifference | — | — | — | — | 26,000 | 52,000 | 78,000 | Same income |
| At 24k total units | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | Stay with old |

---

**Conclusion:**  
The new equipment improves unit margins but raises fixed costs enough that it’s only beneficial above 26,000 composite-unit sales (≈130,000 total units).  
At current 24,000 total sales, the **old equipment** remains preferable.

### The Goldman Company – Multi-Product CVP

**Data (per unit):**  
- Standard: $P=20$, $V=14$, $CM=6$  
- Deluxe: $P=30$, $V=18$, $CM=12$  
- Planned mix: $150{,}000:50{,}000 = 3:1$  
- Fixed costs $F=1{,}200{,}000$

---

#### 1) Breakeven (units) at planned mix

Weighted-average CM per unit (WACM):  
$WACM=\dfrac{6\times3+12\times1}{3+1}=\dfrac{30}{4}=7.5$

Total BE units: $BEP=\dfrac{1{,}200{,}000}{7.5}=160{,}000$ units  
Allocate by mix:  
- Standard: $160{,}000\times\frac{3}{4}=120{,}000$  
- Deluxe: $160{,}000\times\frac{1}{4}=40{,}000$

---

#### 2) Breakeven if only one product is sold

- **Standard only:** $BEP=\dfrac{1{,}200{,}000}{6}=200{,}000$ units  
- **Deluxe only:** $BEP=\dfrac{1{,}200{,}000}{12}=100{,}000$ units

---

#### 3) Actual sales 200,000 units, but only 20,000 are deluxe (i.e., 180,000 standard)

**Operating income at this mix:**  
Total CM $=180{,}000\times6+20{,}000\times12=1{,}080{,}000+240{,}000=1{,}320{,}000$  
OI $=1{,}320{,}000-1{,}200{,}000=\mathbf{120{,}000}$

**New breakeven if this mix persists (9:1):**  
$WACM=\dfrac{6\times9+12\times1}{10}=\dfrac{66}{10}=6.6$  
Total BE units $=\dfrac{1{,}200{,}000}{6.6}\approx 181{,}818$  
Allocate:  
- Standard $\approx 181{,}818\times\frac{9}{10}=163{,}636$  
- Deluxe $\approx 181{,}818\times\frac{1}{10}=18{,}182$

**Comparison / Lesson:**  
At 200,000 total units, planned mix (3:1) would yield $300{,}000$ OI, but the actual mix (9:1) yields only $120{,}000$.  
**Major lesson:** In multi-product CVP, **sales mix materially affects profit and breakeven**. A shift toward the lower-margin product reduces total CM, increases BE units, and lowers operating income even if total units are unchanged.

### Marston Corporation – Choosing Between Compensation Plans

**Given:**  
Sales = $26,000,000$  
Variable manufacturing cost = $11,700,000$  
Fixed manufacturing cost = $2,870,000$  
Operating income (base) = $3,330,000$

---

#### 1) Contribution margin %, breakeven revenue, and DOL

**(a) Using sales agents – 18% commission**

Variable costs:  
- Manufacturing = $11,700,000$  
- Commissions = $0.18 × 26,000,000 = 4,680,000$  
Total variable = $16,380,000$  
CM = $26,000,000 - 16,380,000 = 9,620,000$  
Fixed = $2,870,000 + 3,420,000 = 6,290,000$  
Operating income = $9,620,000 - 6,290,000 = 3,330,000$

CM ratio = $\frac{9,620,000}{26,000,000} = 37\%$  
Breakeven revenue = $\frac{6,290,000}{0.37} = 17,000,000$  
DOL = $\frac{CM}{OI} = \frac{9,620,000}{3,330,000} = 2.89$

---

**(b) Using own sales force – 10% commission, +2,080,000 fixed**

Variable = $11,700,000 + (0.10×26,000,000) = 14,300,000$  
CM = $26,000,000 - 14,300,000 = 11,700,000$  
Fixed = $2,870,000 + 5,500,000 + 2,080,000 = 10,450,000$  
Operating income = $11,700,000 - 10,450,000 = 1,250,000$

CM ratio = $\frac{11,700,000}{26,000,000} = 45\%$  
Breakeven revenue = $\frac{10,450,000}{0.45} = 23,222,000$  
DOL = $\frac{11,700,000}{1,250,000} = 9.36$

---

#### 2) Advantages / Disadvantages

| Using Sales Agents | Using Own Sales Force |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| Low fixed cost, lower risk | Higher fixed cost, greater control |
| Lower operating leverage | Higher operating leverage |
| Less potential upside | Greater potential profit at high volume |
| Less risk during downturns | Higher loss risk if sales drop |

---

#### 3) If commissions rise to 15%

Variable = $11,700,000 + (0.15×Sales)$  
Fixed = $2,870,000 + 5,500,000 + 2,080,000 = 10,450,000$  

Set OI = $3,330,000$ (target):

$Sales - (11,700,000 + 0.15S) - 10,450,000 = 3,330,000$  
$0.85S = 25,480,000$  
$S = 30,000,000$

**Result:**  
Revenue must rise from $26M → $30M$ (≈15% increase) to maintain the same profit.

---

**Interpretation:**  
The own sales force plan gives higher CM and leverage but also much higher fixed costs, increasing both potential gain and risk.  
Operating leverage magnifies the effect of sales changes on income which is beneficial in growth, dangerous in decline.

[Table of Contents](#Table-of-Contents)


![3-42](/images/accounting/3-42.jpeg)

### Manitoba Production Corporation – Special Order Decision

**Given:**
- Product A (bottle):  
  - $P = 0.55$, $V = 0.25$, CM = $0.30$ per unit  
  - Machine time = $100$ bottles/hour  
- Product B (toy):  
  - $P = 3.40$, $V = 2.70$, CM = $0.70$ per unit  
  - Additional cost (mould) = $24{,}000$ (fixed)  
  - Machine time = $40$ toys/hour  
- Capacity = 10,000 machine hours total  
- Fixed costs (excluding mould) = $220{,}000$  
- Toy order = 100,000 units  

---

#### 1) Bottle demand = 750,000 units

**Step 1 – Machine hours required:**  
Bottles = $750{,}000 / 100 = 7{,}500$ hrs  
Toys = $100{,}000 / 40 = 2{,}500$ hrs  
Total = $10{,}000$ hrs → fits within capacity.

**Step 2 – Incremental analysis:**  
Bottles not displaced → no lost contribution.

Toy order contribution = $100{,}000 × 0.70 - 24{,}000 = 70{,}000 - 24{,}000 = 46{,}000$

**Decision:** Accept the order (adds $46{,}000$ to income).

---

#### 2) Bottle demand = 850,000 units

**Step 1 – Hours used if both produced:**  
Bottles = $8{,}500$ hrs  
Toys = $2{,}500$ hrs  
Total = $11{,}000$ hrs → exceeds capacity by $1{,}000$ hrs.

Must give up $1{,}000 × 100 = 100{,}000$ bottles.

**Step 2 – Lost CM from displaced bottles:**  
$100{,}000 × 0.30 = 30{,}000$

**Step 3 – Incremental income from toy order:**  
Toy contribution $= 70{,}000 - 24{,}000 = 46{,}000$  
Net benefit = $46{,}000 - 30{,}000 = 16{,}000$

**Decision:** Accept — still adds $16{,}000$ to income.

---

#### 3) Bottle demand = 900,000 units

**Step 1 – Hours used if both produced:**  
Bottles = $9{,}000$ hrs  
Toys = $2{,}500$ hrs  
Total = $11{,}500$ hrs → exceeds capacity by $1{,}500$ hrs.

Lost bottles = $1{,}500 × 100 = 150{,}000$

Lost CM = $150{,}000 × 0.30 = 45{,}000$

Toy contribution = $70{,}000 - 24{,}000 = 46{,}000$

Net = $46{,}000 - 45{,}000 = 1{,}000$

**Decision:** Accept marginally beneficial (adds $1{,}000$).

---

#### Summary

| Scenario | Bottle Demand | Toy CM | Lost Bottle CM | Mould Cost | Net Effect | Decision |
|-----------|---------------|---------|----------------|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| 1 | 750,000 | 70,000 | 0 | 24,000 | +46,000 | Accept |
| 2 | 850,000 | 70,000 | 30,000 | 24,000 | +16,000 | Accept |
| 3 | 900,000 | 70,000 | 45,000 | 24,000 | +1,000 | Accept (barely) |

---

**Interpretation:**  
- The toy order is acceptable under all scenarios, though the benefit sharply declines as capacity tightens.  
- Once bottle demand exceeds 900,000, the opportunity cost will likely outweigh the toy order’s gain.

[Table of Contents](#Table-of-Contents)


![3-48](/images/accounting/3-48.jpeg)

### Domestic Engines – Two-Plant CVP & Allocation

**Given (per unit):**

- **Peona:**  
  $P=150$; variable manufacturing $=72$; variable marketing $=14$ → $CM=64$  
  fixed/unit at 240 days $=30+19=49$  
  rate $=400$/day → normal $=400×240=96{,}000$; max $=400×300=120{,}000$  
  if >240 days: variable manufacturing +$3 →$ extra-units $CM=61$

- **Modine:**  
  $P=150$; variable manufacturing $=88$; variable marketing $=14$ → $CM=48$  
  fixed/unit at 240 days $=15+14.5=29.5$  
  rate $=320$/day → normal $=320×240=76{,}800$; max $=320×300=96{,}000$  
  if >240 days: variable manufacturing +$8 →$ extra-units $CM=40$

- **Annual fixed costs (based on 240 days):**  
  Peona $F=49×96{,}000=4{,}704{,}000$  
  Modine $F=29.5×76{,}800=2{,}265{,}600$

---

#### 1) Breakeven point (units)

Peona: $BEP=\dfrac{4{,}704{,}000}{64}=73{,}500$ units  
Modine: $BEP=\dfrac{2{,}265{,}600}{48}=47{,}200$ units

---

#### 2) Operating income if each plant makes 96,000 units (total 192,000)

- **Peona (all at normal CM 64):**  
  OI $=96{,}000×64 - 4{,}704{,}000 = 1{,}440{,}000$

- **Modine (needs 300 days → 76,800 normal at CM 48; 19,200 extra at CM 40):**  
  Total CM $=76{,}800×48 + 19{,}200×40 = 4{,}454{,}400$  
  OI $=4{,}454{,}400 - 2{,}265{,}600 = 2{,}188{,}800$

**Total operating income (plan)** $=1{,}440{,}000+2{,}188{,}800=\mathbf{3{,}628{,}800}$

---

#### 3) Optimal allocation of 192,000 units to maximize operating income

**Rank CM:** Peona normal $64$ > Peona extra $61$ > Modine normal $48$ > Modine extra $40$.

- Produce **Peona to max**: $120{,}000$ units  
  CM $=96{,}000×64 + 24{,}000×61 = 7{,}344{,}000$  
  OI $=7{,}344{,}000 - 4{,}704{,}000 = 2{,}640{,}000$  ← (check step below)

(Explicit revenue/variable-cost route:)

Revenue $=120{,}000×150=18{,}000{,}000$  
Variable cost $=96{,}000×(72+14) + 24{,}000×(75+14) = 10{,}656{,}000$  
OI $=18{,}000{,}000 - 10{,}656{,}000 - 4{,}704{,}000 = \mathbf{2{,}904{,}000}$

- Remaining to reach $192{,}000$: **Modine 72,000** (all normal at CM 48)  
  OI $=72{,}000×48 - 2{,}265{,}600 = 1{,}190{,}400$

**Total optimal OI** $=2{,}904{,}000 + 1{,}190{,}400 = \mathbf{4{,}094{,}400}$

**Improvement over manager’s plan:** $4{,}094{,}400 - 3{,}628{,}800 = \mathbf{465{,}600}$

**Recommendation:** Allocate **120,000 units to Peona** and **72,000 to Modine**.

## 4-18-Actual-Costing-vs-Normal-Costing
[Table of Contents](#Table-of-Contents)
![4-18](/images/accounting/4-18.jpeg)

**Given Data**

| Category | Budgeted | Actual |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Direct manufacturing labour cost | 2,700,000 | 2,660,800 |
| Manufacturing overhead cost | 2,322,000 | 2,340,800 |
| Direct materials cost | 1,900,000 | 1,790,000 |

**Job 626 (March):**  
Direct materials = 58,000  
Direct manufacturing labour = 34,000

---

#### 1) Compute the actual and budgeted manufacturing overhead rates

Budgeted rate = 2,322,000 ÷ 2,700,000 = **0.86 (86%)**  
Actual rate = 2,340,800 ÷ 2,660,800 = **0.88 (88%)**

---

#### 2) Compute the cost of Job 626 using  
a) an **actual-costing system**, and  
b) a **normal-costing system**

a) **Actual-costing system**

Overhead applied = 0.88 × 34,000 = 29,920  
Total job cost = Direct materials + Direct labour + Applied overhead  
= 58,000 + 34,000 + 29,920 = **121,920**

b) **Normal-costing system**

Overhead applied = 0.86 × 34,000 = 29,240  
Total job cost = 58,000 + 34,000 + 29,240 = **121,240**

---

#### 3) Compute the underapplied or overapplied manufacturing overhead

Applied (normal system) = 0.86 × 2,660,800 = 2,288,288  
Actual = 2,340,800  

**Underapplied overhead = 2,340,800 − 2,288,288 = 52,512**

There is no under/overallocation under actual costing because actual costs are used directly.

---

#### 4) Comment on advantages and disadvantages

**Actual costing**
- Uses actual overhead and labour rates → most accurate reflection of costs.  
- Not timely, since overhead figures are known only after period end.  
- Less useful for day-to-day job pricing or management control.

**Normal costing**
- Uses budgeted overhead rate → allows timely cost information during production.  
- Slightly less accurate; differences arise as over/underapplied overhead.  
- Better for planning and performance evaluation.

**Summary:**  
Normal costing trades slight accuracy loss for faster, practical decision-making. Actual costing is precise but slow.

### Job Costing: Actual, Normal, and Budgeted Costing (4-20)

**Given data**

| Category | Budgeted | Actual |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Professional labour costs | 1,100,000 | 1,320,000 |
| Support costs | 2,000,000 | 2,400,000 |
| Professional labour-hours | 20,000* | 22,000 |

\*8 lawyers × 2,500 hours = 20,000 hours

---

#### 1) Compute the direct and indirect cost rates per professional labour-hour

a) **Actual costing**

Direct cost rate = 1,320,000 ÷ 22,000 = **$60/hour**  
Indirect cost rate = 2,400,000 ÷ 22,000 = **$109.09/hour**

b) **Normal costing**

Direct cost rate = 1,320,000 ÷ 22,000 = **$60/hour**  
Indirect cost rate = 2,000,000 ÷ 20,000 = **$100/hour**

c) **Budgeted costing (both rates budgeted)**

Direct cost rate = 1,100,000 ÷ 20,000 = **$55/hour**  
Indirect cost rate = 2,000,000 ÷ 20,000 = **$100/hour**

---

#### 2) Compute total job cost for Ari Roos (4 lawyers × 500 hours = 2,000 total hours)

a) **Actual costing**

Direct costs = 2,000 × 60 = 120,000  
Indirect costs = 2,000 × 109.09 = 218,180  
**Total = $338,180**

b) **Normal costing**

Direct costs = 2,000 × 60 = 120,000  
Indirect costs = 2,000 × 100 = 200,000  
**Total = $320,000**

c) **Budgeted costing**

Direct costs = 2,000 × 55 = 110,000  
Indirect costs = 2,000 × 100 = 200,000  
**Total = $310,000**

---

#### 3) Interpretation

- Actual costing uses both actual rates → most accurate, but not timely.  
- Normal costing uses budgeted overhead → faster, suitable for interim reporting.  
- Budgeted costing uses budgeted direct and indirect rates → least precise, but ideal for pricing and planning early in the year.

### Job Costing: Normal vs Actual Costing (4-21)

**Given data**

| Category | Budgeted | Actual |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Assembly support costs | 7,200,000 | 6,888,000 |
| Direct labour-hours | 150,000 | 164,000 |

**Job data**

| Job | Direct Materials | Direct Labour | Labour-Hours |
|-----|------------------|---------------|---------------|
| Laguna Model | 106,450 | 35,275 | 850 |
| Mission Model | 127,604 | 40,320 | 960 |

---

#### 1) Compute (a) budgeted and (b) actual indirect cost rate

(a) Budgeted rate = 7,200,000 ÷ 150,000 = **$48 per direct labour-hour**  
(b) Actual rate = 6,888,000 ÷ 164,000 = **$42 per direct labour-hour**

**Reason for difference:**  
Both numerator and denominator differ — actual costs were lower and more labour-hours occurred, decreasing the actual rate.

---

#### 2) Compute job costs under (a) normal and (b) actual costing

**a) Normal costing (uses budgeted $48/hour)**  

| Job | Direct Materials | Direct Labour | Assembly Support | **Total** |
|------|------------------|---------------|------------------|------------|
| Laguna | 106,450 | 35,275 | 850 × 48 = 40,800 | **182,525** |
| Mission | 127,604 | 40,320 | 960 × 48 = 46,080 | **214,004** |

**b) Actual costing (uses actual $42/hour)**  

| Job | Direct Materials | Direct Labour | Assembly Support | **Total** |
|------|------------------|---------------|------------------|------------|
| Laguna | 106,450 | 35,275 | 850 × 42 = 35,700 | **177,425** |
| Mission | 127,604 | 40,320 | 960 × 42 = 40,320 | **208,244** |

---

#### 3) Why Anderson Construction might prefer normal costing

- **Timeliness:** Normal costing allows job cost estimation as soon as labour-hours are known.  
- **Decision support:** Enables quick pricing, cost control, and bidding.  
- **Practicality:** Actual costing requires year-end data, delaying decisions.  
- **Stability:** Budgeted rates smooth short-term fluctuations in overhead.

## 4-24-Job-Costing-Journal-Entries-and-T-Accounts
[Table of Contents](#Table-of-Contents)
![4-24](/images/accounting/4-24.jpeg)

**Given**

Normal job costing with one MOH cost pool allocated on machine hours  
Budgeted MOH = 80,000,000 with 1,000,000 MH  
Actual MH used = 937,500  
Selected 2025 amounts in millions are shown in the image

Budgeted MOH rate = 80,000,000 ÷ 1,000,000 = 80 per MH  
Allocated MOH for 937,500 MH = 80 × 937,500 = 75.0 

---

#### 1) Journal entries and posting to T accounts plus ending WIP balance

Use the following entries (amounts in millions)

(1) Materials Control 240  
……Accounts Payable Control 240  

(2) Work in Process Control 198  
……Materials Control 198  

(3) Manufacturing Overhead Control 24  
……Materials Control 24  

(4) Work in Process Control 127  
……Manufacturing Overhead Control 21  
……Wages Payable Control 148  

(5) Manufacturing Overhead Control 23  
……Accumulated Depreciation 23  

(6) Manufacturing Overhead Control 10  
……Various Liabilities 10  

(7) Work in Process Control 75  
……Manufacturing Overhead Allocated 75  

(8) Finished Goods Control 374.6  
……Work in Process Control 374.6  

(9a) Cost of Goods Sold 369  
……Finished Goods Control 369  

(9b) Accounts Receivable Control 540  
……Revenue 540 

Posting these to T accounts yields an **ending balance of Work in Process Control = 27.0** (millions). 

---

#### 2) Year end write off of under or overallocated MOH directly to Cost of Goods Sold and posting

Manufacturing Overhead Control has 78 (actual) and Manufacturing Overhead Allocated has 75  
Underallocated MOH = 3

Entry  
Manufacturing Overhead Allocated 75.0  
Cost of Goods Sold 3.0  
……Manufacturing Overhead Control 78.0

This closes both MOH accounts and records the 3.0 underallocation to COGS.

### Job Costing with Actual, Normal, and Budgeted Costing Rates (4-27)

**Given data**

| Category | Budgeted | Actual |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Direct labour costs | 273,000 | 285,000 |
| Direct labour hours | 10,500 | 11,400 |
| Overhead costs | 157,500 | 159,600 |

---

#### 1) Compute the direct- and indirect-cost rates per web-designing labour-hour

**a) Actual costing**

Direct-cost rate = 285,000 ÷ 11,400 = **$25/hour**  
Indirect-cost rate = 159,600 ÷ 11,400 = **$14/hour**

**b) Normal costing**

Direct-cost rate = actual direct labour rate = **$25/hour**  
Indirect-cost rate = budgeted 157,500 ÷ 10,500 = **$15/hour**

**c) Variation from normal costing (both budgeted)**

Direct-cost rate = budgeted 273,000 ÷ 10,500 = **$26/hour**  
Indirect-cost rate = budgeted 157,500 ÷ 10,500 = **$15/hour**

---

#### 2) Recommended costing method

**Normal costing** is preferred because:  
- It provides timely job cost information.  
- It avoids delays in waiting for actual overhead data.  
- It maintains accuracy since direct labour costs are known in real time.  
- Actual costing is too slow for day-to-day project management, and fully budgeted costing is less precise.

---

#### 3) Compute Greenville Day School project cost  
Budgeted hours = 86  
Actual hours = 79

**a) Actual costing**

Direct = 79 × 25 = 1,975  
Overhead = 79 × 14 = 1,106  
**Total = 3,081**

**b) Normal costing**

Direct = 79 × 25 = 1,975  
Overhead = 79 × 15 = 1,185  
**Total = 3,160**

**c) Variation from normal (both budgeted)**

Direct = 86 × 26 = 2,236  
Overhead = 86 × 15 = 1,290  
**Total = 3,526**

---

#### 4) Discussion

- Actual costing shows the most precise ex post cost but is impractical for planning.  
- Normal costing balances timeliness and realism.  
- The fully budgeted variation helps in forward pricing and budgeting.  
- Differences arise due to both rate variance and efficiency (actual hours < budgeted hours).

### Manufacturing Overhead Proration Methods (4-28)

**Given data**

| Category | Budgeted | Actual |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Manufacturing overhead costs | 100,000 | 106,000 |
| Direct manufacturing labour cost | 200,000 | 220,000 |

| Account | Ending Balance | Direct Labour Cost in Ending Balance |
|----------|----------------|--------------------------------------|
| Work in Process | 50,000 | 20,000 |
| Finished Goods | 240,000 | 60,000 |
| Cost of Goods Sold | 560,000 | 140,000 |

---

#### 1) Budgeted manufacturing overhead rate

Budgeted MOH rate = 100,000 ÷ 200,000 = **50% of direct labour cost**

---

#### 2) Under- or overallocated manufacturing overhead

Applied MOH = 50% × 220,000 = 110,000  
Actual MOH = 106,000  
**Overallocated = 110,000 − 106,000 = 4,000**

---

#### 3) Adjusting under/overallocated overhead

**a) Written off to Cost of Goods Sold**

COGS (after adjustment) = 560,000 − 4,000 = **556,000**  
WIP and Finished Goods remain unchanged.

---

**b) Prorated based on ending balances (before proration)**

Total = 50,000 + 240,000 + 560,000 = 850,000  

Ratios:  
WIP 50,000/850,000 = 0.0588  
FG 240,000/850,000 = 0.2824  
COGS 560,000/850,000 = 0.6588  

Allocation of 4,000 overallocated:  
WIP = 235, FG = 1,130, COGS = 2,635  

Adjusted balances:  
WIP = 49,765  
FG = 238,870  
COGS = 557,365  

---

**c) Prorated based on overhead allocated during the year**

Total overhead allocated:  
WIP 20,000 × 50% = 10,000  
FG 60,000 × 50% = 30,000  
COGS 140,000 × 50% = 70,000  
Total = 110,000  

Ratios:  
WIP 0.0909, FG 0.2727, COGS 0.6364  

Allocation of 4,000 overallocated:  
WIP = 364, FG = 1,091, COGS = 2,545  

Adjusted balances:  
WIP = 49,636  
FG = 238,909  
COGS = 557,455  

---

#### 4) Preferred method

**Method (c)** — proration based on overhead applied is most accurate,  
since it aligns the correction with how overhead was distributed during production, ensuring fair adjustment between inventory and expense accounts.

### Job Costing in a Law Firm (4-30)

**Given data**

- Professionals = 25  
- Budgeted compensation per professional = \$104,000  
- Budgeted billable hours per professional = 1,600  
- Total budgeted indirect (support) costs = \$2,200,000  

---

#### 1) Budgeted direct cost rate per professional labour-hour

Total professional labour cost = 25 × 104,000 = 2,600,000  
Total professional labour-hours = 25 × 1,600 = 40,000  

Direct cost rate = 2,600,000 ÷ 40,000 = **\$65 per hour**

---

#### 2) Budgeted indirect cost rate per professional labour-hour

Indirect cost rate = 2,200,000 ÷ 40,000 = **\$55 per hour**

---

#### 3) Cost estimates for two client jobs

| Job | Hours | Direct Cost | Indirect Cost | Total Cost |
|------|--------|--------------|----------------|-------------|
| a) Litigation (Richardson Inc.) | 100 | 100 × 65 = 6,500 | 100 × 55 = 5,500 | **12,000** |
| b) Labour contract (Punch Inc.) | 150 | 150 × 65 = 9,750 | 150 × 55 = 8,250 | **18,000** |

---

#### 4) Interpretation

- **Direct costs** represent professional compensation traced by labour-hours.  
- **Indirect (support) costs** include administrative, paralegal, and facility support allocated based on professional hours.  
- This rate structure gives transparency in client billing and internal performance tracking.

### Departmental Overhead Allocation and Proration (4-33)

**Given data**

| Department | Budgeted OH | Actual OH | Budgeted Base | Actual Base |
|-------------|--------------|-------------|----------------|--------------|
| Machining | 5,850,000 | 5,470,000 | 90,000 MH | 92,000 MH total (69,000+6,900+16,100 = 92,000) |
| Assembly | 7,812,000 | 8,234,000 | 124,000 DMLH | 128,000 DMLH total (83,200+12,800+32,000 = 128,000) |

---

#### 1) Compute budgeted overhead rates

Machining OH rate = 5,850,000 ÷ 90,000 = **$65/MH**  
Assembly OH rate = 7,812,000 ÷ 124,000 = **$63/DMLH**

---

#### 2) Compute under/overallocated overhead

**Machining Department**

Applied OH = 92,000 × 65 = 5,980,000  
Actual OH = 5,470,000  
→ **Overallocated = 510,000**

**Assembly Department**

Applied OH = 128,000 × 63 = 8,064,000  
Actual OH = 8,234,000  
→ **Underallocated = 170,000**

---

#### 3) Immediate write-off to Cost of Goods Sold

Net = Overallocated 510,000 − Underallocated 170,000 = **340,000 overallocated**  
→ Decrease COGS by **340,000**

Adjusted COGS = 21,600,000 − 340,000 = **21,260,000**

---

#### 4) Proration based on ending balances (before proration)

| Account | Balance | % of total (32,400,000) | Allocation of 340,000 |
|----------|----------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| WIP | 7,600,000 | 0.235 | 80,000 |
| FG | 2,800,000 | 0.086 | 29,000 |
| COGS | 21,600,000 | 0.667 | 227,000 |

Adjusted balances (overallocated reduction):

WIP = 7,520,000  
FG = 2,771,000  
COGS = 21,373,000  

---

#### 5) Proration based on overhead applied during the year

Allocate 340,000 proportionally to applied OH in each account.  
Overhead applied ≈ proportional to labour/machine usage.

Machining and assembly usage summary:

| Account | MH (Mach.) | DMLH (Assem.) |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| COGS | 69,000 | 83,200 |
| FG | 6,900 | 12,800 |
| WIP | 16,100 | 32,000 |

Compute total OH applied before adjustment:
Machining (65×MH) + Assembly (63×DMLH)

| Account | Applied OH | % of total (5,980,000+8,064,000=14,044,000) | Allocated share of 340,000 |
|----------|-------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| WIP | 1,046,500 + 2,016,000 = 3,062,500 | 21.8% | 74,000 |
| FG | 448,500 + 806,400 = 1,254,900 | 8.9% | 30,000 |
| COGS | 4,485,000 + 5,241,600 = 9,726,600 | 69.3% | 236,000 |

Adjusted balances:

WIP = 7,526,000  
FG = 2,770,000  
COGS = 21,364,000  

---

#### 6) Discussion

- Both departments use **normal costing** (budgeted rates × actual activity).  
- Overhead is slightly overapplied overall (mainly from the Machining Department).  
- The **proration based on overhead applied** (method c) is preferred because it distributes the adjustment proportionally to resource consumption.  
- The immediate write-off method is simplest but distorts inventory valuation.

### Solutions

1. One common **refinement** to a traditional or **peanut butter** costing system is called an **activity-based costing (ABC) system**.  
   → (ABC refines cost systems by replacing a single broad overhead rate with multiple cost pools.)

2. The single manufacturing overhead cost pool is separated into different **activity cost pools**, distinguished from one another by their measure of benefits provided, or the **activity cost driver**.  

3. Benefits provided unequally to distinct types of outputs provide value added to customers, for which customers are willing to pay. This is the basic concept that guides the approach to cost reduction and control called **activity-based management (ABM)**.  

4. The management team identifies and eliminates **non–value-added activity** and its costs and reorganizes the **value-added activity** to minimize costs.  

5. There are four levels of activities in a cost hierarchy. From narrowest to broadest in scope they are **output unit-level cost**, **batch-level cost**, **product (or service)-sustaining cost**, and **facility-sustaining cost**.  

6. When a management team fails to develop a cost management system that reports faithfully the unequal benefits (and costs) of value-added activities, there is a high risk of mispricing distinct types of outputs. If managers use **cost-plus** pricing, an overcosted output will be priced too high and an undercosted product will be priced too low relative to the economic value added. The result is preventable **cross-subsidization** of costs of the lower-priced by the higher-priced product.

### Plantwide Overhead Rate (based on total direct costs)

**Step 1:**  
$\text{Total Overhead} = 48,000 + 32,000 + 40,000 = \$120,000$

**Step 2:**  
$\text{Total Direct Costs (DM + DL)} = (95,000 + 50,000 + 15,000 + 40,000) = \$200,000$

**Step 3:**  
$\text{Plantwide Overhead Rate} = \dfrac {\$120,000} {\$200,000} = 60\% \text{ of direct costs}$

Based on Formula:

$\dfrac {\text{Total Overhead}}  {\text{Cost-Allocation-Base}}$

**Step 4:**  

| Product | Direct Cost | OH (×60%) | Total Cost | Unit Cost |
|---|--------------|------------|-------------|------------|
| Basic | \$110,000 | \$66,000 | \$176,000 | **\$17.60/unit** |
| Deluxe | \$90,000 | \$54,000 | \$144,000 | **\$28.80/unit** |


---

### Departmental Overhead Rates

**Forming Department**  
- $\text{OH} = 48{,}000 + 32{,}000 = 80{,}000$  
- $\text{Base} = \text{Direct Labour (Forming)} = 50{,}000$  
- $\text{Rate} = \dfrac{80{,}000}{50{,}000} = 160\%\text{ of DL}$

**Assembly Department**  
- $\text{OH} = 40{,}000$  
- $\text{Base} = \text{Direct Labour (Assembly)} = 40{,}000$  
- $\text{Rate} = \dfrac{40{,}000}{40{,}000} = 100\%\text{ of DL}$


**Overhead Applied per Product**

| Product | Forming DL | OH (160%) | Assembly DL | OH (100%) | Total OH | Total Cost | Unit Cost |
|----------|-------------|-----------|--------------|------------|-----------|-------------|------------|
| Basic | 30,000 | 48,000 | 15,000 | 15,000 | **63,000** | 110,000 + 63,000 = **173,000** | **\$17.30/unit** |
| Deluxe | 20,000 | 32,000 | 25,000 | 25,000 | **57,000** | 90,000 + 57,000 = **147,000** | **\$29.40/unit** |

---

### Activity-Based Costing (ABC)

**Step 1:**  
Identify cost pools and drivers:  
- **Setup cost pool (\$48,000)** → allocated based on number of batches  
- **General overhead (Forming \$32,000 + Assembly \$40,000)** → allocated based on departmental direct labour cost

**Step 2:**  
Batches:  
- $\text{Basic:} \dfrac{10,000}  {200} = 50 \text{ batches}$  
- $\text{Deluxe:} \dfrac{5,000} {50} = 100 \text{ batches}$

Total batches = 150  
Setup cost per batch = $\dfrac {48,000}  {150} = \$320 \text{ per batch}$

**Step 3:**  
Assign setup costs:  
- $\text{Basic} = 50 \times 320 = 16,000$ 
- $\text{Deluxe} = 100 \times 320 = 32,000$  

**Step 4:**  
General overhead allocation:  
- Forming DL total = $50{,}000$  
  → Deluxe share = $\dfrac{20{,}000}{50{,}000} = 0.40$  
  → Deluxe forming-general OH = $32{,000} \times 0.40 = 12{,}800$

- Assembly DL total = $40{,}000$  
  → Deluxe share = $\dfrac{25{,}000}{40{,}000} = 0.625$
  → Deluxe assembly OH = $40{,000} \times 0.625 = 25{,}000$

- Basic forming-general OH = $32{,000} - 12{,}800 = 19{,}200$

- Basic assembly OH = $40{,000} - 25{,}000 = 15{,}000$

- Basic total (these two) = $19{,}200 + 15{,}000 = 34{,}200$

**Step 5:**  
Overhead summary  

| Product | Setup OH | General OH | Total OH |
|----------|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| Basic | 16,000 | 34,200 | **50,200** |
| Deluxe | 32,000 | 37,800 | **69,800** |

**Step 6:**  
Total cost and per-unit cost  

| Product | Direct Cost | Total OH | Total Cost | Unit Cost |
|----------|--------------|-----------|-------------|------------|
| Basic | 110,000 | 50,200 | 160,200 | **\$16.02/unit** |
| Deluxe | 90,000 | 69,800 | 159,800 | **\$31.96/unit** |

---

### Explanation & Recommendation

- **Plantwide rate** assumes all overhead varies with total direct costs, causing **cross-subsidization** (basic undercosted, deluxe overcosted).  
- **Departmental rates** improve accuracy by recognizing departmental differences but still rely on labour as a single driver.  
- **Activity-Based Costing (ABC)** reflects true resource usage, capturing batch-level setups and complex processes in the deluxe product.  

**Recommendation:**  
Use **ABC**, as it best represents the actual consumption of overhead resources and avoids product cost distortion—crucial when product complexity and volume differ.

### Given Data

| Product | Annual Units | Direct Material | Direct Labour | Direct Labour-Hours | Machine-Hours | Production Runs | Inspection Hours |
|----------|---------------|------------------|----------------|----------------------|----------------|-----------------|------------------|

|----------------|-------------|
| Machining | \$360,000 |
| Setup | \$108,000 |
| Inspection | \$117,000 |

---

### Determine Cost Drivers and Calculate Overhead Rate per Activity

| Activity | Cost Driver | Total Driver Units | Rate per Driver Unit |
|-----------|--------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Machining | Machine-hours (90,000 total) | 90,000 | $\frac{360{,}000}{90{,}000} = \$4$ per machine-hour |
| Setup | Number of production runs (45 + 45 = 90 total) | 90 | $\frac{108{,}000}{90} = \$1{,}200$ per run |
| Inspection | Inspection-hours (1,200 + 600 = 1,800 total) | 1,800 | $\frac{117{,}000}{1{,}800} = \$65$ per inspection-hour |

---

### Assign Overhead to Each Product

| Product | Machining (Rate × MH) | Setup (Rate × Runs) | Inspection (Rate × Hours) | Total OH |
|----------|------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------|-----------|
| Mathematical | $30{,}000 × 4 = 120{,}000$ | $45 × 1{,}200 = 54{,}000$ | $1{,}200 × 65 = 78{,}000$ | **\$252,000** |
| Financial | $60{,}000 × 4 = 240{,}000$ | $45 × 1{,}200 = 54{,}000$ | $600 × 65 = 39{,}000$ | **\$333,000** |

---

### Compute Total and Per-Unit Manufacturing Costs

| Product | Direct Materials | Direct Labour | Overhead | Total Cost | Units | Unit Cost |
|----------|------------------|---------------|-----------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Mathematical | 180,000 | 90,000 | 252,000 | 522,000 | 45,000 | $\frac{522{,}000}{45{,}000} = \$11.60$ |
| Financial | 360,000 | 180,000 | 333,000 | 873,000 | 90,000 | $\frac{873{,}000}{90{,}000} = \$9.70$ |

---

### Managerial Interpretation

- The **mathematical calculator** requires more inspection and setup resources per unit, resulting in higher unit costs under ABC.  
- The **financial calculator**, produced in higher volume with fewer inspection hours per unit, consumes proportionally less overhead.  
- Traditional cost systems would likely overcost the financial model and undercost the mathematical one, causing **cross-subsidization**.  
- Using ABC allows managers to:
  - Identify resource-intensive activities (like inspections and setups).
  - Improve **pricing accuracy** and **product mix** decisions.
  - Target process improvements where overhead consumption is excessive.

| Store support (ABC)      | 18,840     | 12,720             | 5,640           | 37,200  |
| **Operating income**     | **160**    | **2,780**          | **12,860**      | **15,800** |

#### 3. Insights from ABC

- Simple costing (30% of COGS) makes all three product lines look similarly profitable; milk & fruit juice almost break even.
- ABC shows that **frozen products are much more profitable**, while baked goods consume a lot of ordering, delivery, and customer-support resources and are barely profitable.
- Management attention should focus on:
  - Improving margins or reducing support activities for baked goods, or
  - Emphasizing frozen products (and possibly milk & fruit juice) in pricing and promotion decisions.

#### 1. Cost hierarchy level for each category

- Direct materials – purses: **Output unit-level**
- Direct materials – backpacks: **Output unit-level**
- Direct manufacturing labour – purses: **Output unit-level**
- Direct manufacturing labour – backpacks: **Output unit-level**
- Setup: **Batch-level** (incurred per batch when equipment is set up for a design)
- Shipping: **Batch-level** (each batch is shipped when completed)
- Design: **Product-sustaining** (supports each design line of bags)
- Plant utilities and administration: **Facility-sustaining** (keeps the plant operating)

#### 2. Appropriate cost drivers

- Direct materials & direct manufacturing labour: traced directly to each product line (driver is the actual usage – number of units or hours).
- Setup: **Number of batches** (setups occur when production switches to a new batch).
- Shipping: **Number of batches/shipments** (shipping costs vary with shipments).
- Design: **Number of designs** (each design requires its own design effort).
- Plant utilities and administration: **Hours of production** (longer run time uses more facility resources).

#### 3. Budgeted cost per unit of cost driver

Totals from the problem:

- Number of bags: $9{,}250$
- Hours of production: $4{,}250$
- Number of batches: $200$
- Number of designs: $4$

Compute driver rates:

- Setup: $64{,}000 / 200 = 320$ per batch
- Shipping: $73{,}000 / 200 = 365$ per batch (shipment)
- Design: $169{,}000 / 4 = 42{,}250$ per design
- Plant utilities & administration: $221{,}000 / 4{,}250 = 52$ per production hour

#### 4. Budgeted total costs and cost per unit (bag)

Driver usage:

- Backpacks:  
  - Bags: $6{,}175$  
  - Hours: $1{,}665$  
  - Batches: $120$  
  - Designs: $2$
- Purses:  
  - Bags: $3{,}075$  
  - Hours: $2{,}585$  
  - Batches: $80$  
  - Designs: $2$

Overhead allocations:

Backpacks  
- Setup: $120 \times 320 = 38{,}400$  
- Shipping: $120 \times 365 = 43{,}800$  
- Design: $2 \times 42{,}250 = 84{,}500$  
- Plant utilities/admin: $1{,}665 \times 52 = 86{,}580$

Purses  
- Setup: $80 \times 320 = 25{,}600$  
- Shipping: $80 \times 365 = 29{,}200$  
- Design: $2 \times 42{,}250 = 84{,}500$  
- Plant utilities/admin: $2{,}585 \times 52 = 134{,}420$

Total costs & unit costs:

Backpacks  
- Direct materials: $454{,}995$  
- Direct labour: $113{,}000$  
- Overhead (sum above): $38{,}400 + 43{,}800 + 84{,}500 + 86{,}580 = 253{,}280$  
- **Total cost**: $454{,}995 + 113{,}000 + 253{,}280 = 821{,}275$  
- **Cost per backpack**: $821{,}275 / 6{,}175 \approx 133$

Purses  
- Direct materials: $319{,}155$  
- Direct labour: $99{,}000$  
- Overhead: $25{,}600 + 29{,}200 + 84{,}500 + 134{,}420 = 273{,}720$  
- **Total cost**: $319{,}155 + 99{,}000 + 273{,}720 = 691{,}875$  
- **Cost per purse**: $691{,}875 / 3{,}075 \approx 225$

#### 5. Using this information to reduce costs

- Backpacks use fewer production hours than purses but more batches.  
- Purses use **more production hours** and thus more facility resources; unit cost is much higher.  
- Management can:
  - Reduce the number of designs or complexity for purses.
  - Increase batch sizes to spread setup and shipping costs.
  - Improve production efficiency (reduce hours of production).
  - Evaluate whether price increases or product redesigns are needed, especially for purses.

[Table of Contents](#Table-of-Contents)
![5-32](/images/accounting/5-32-1.jpeg)
![5-32](/images/accounting/5-32-2.jpeg)

#### 1. Classify each activity cost

1. Direct labour costs ($288{,}000$):  
   - **Output unit-level** – incurred for each test-hour.

2. Equipment-related costs ($480{,}000$):  
   - **Output unit-level** – vary with total test-hours.

3. Setup costs ($420{,}000$):  
   - **Batch-level** – incurred per setup (per batch of tests).

4. Costs of designing tests ($252{,}000$):  
   - **Product- or service-sustaining** – support design of each type of test, not individual test-hours.

#### 2. ABC cost per test-hour for HT and ST

Total test-hours:  
$50{,}000$ (HT) + $30{,}000$ (ST) = $80{,}000$ hours.

Activity rates:

- Equipment-related:  
  $480{,}000 / 80{,}000 = 6$ per test-hour
- Setup:  
  Total setup-hours = $13{,}500 + 4{,}000 = 17{,}500$  
  Rate $= 420{,}000 / 17{,}500 = 24$ per setup-hour
- Design:  
  Total design-hours = $2{,}800 + 1{,}400 = 4{,}200$  
  Rate $= 252{,}000 / 4{,}200 = 60$ per design-hour

Allocations to each service:

Heat testing (HT)

- Direct labour: $216{,}000$
- Equipment: $50{,}000 \times 6 = 300{,}000$
- Setup: $13{,}500 \times 24 = 324{,}000$
- Design: $2{,}800 \times 60 = 168{,}000$

Total HT cost:  
$216{,}000 + 300{,}000 + 324{,}000 + 168{,}000 = 1{,}008{,}000$

Cost per test-hour HT:  
$1{,}008{,}000 / 50{,}000 = 20.16$

Stress testing (ST)

- Direct labour: $72{,}000$
- Equipment: $30{,}000 \times 6 = 180{,}000$
- Setup: $4{,}000 \times 24 = 96{,}000$
- Design: $1{,}400 \times 60 = 84{,}000$

Total ST cost:  
$72{,}000 + 180{,}000 + 96{,}000 + 84{,}000 = 432{,}000$

Cost per test-hour ST:  
$432{,}000 / 30{,}000 = 14.40$

The old system charged a uniform $18$ per test-hour, so HT was **undercosted** and ST **overcosted** relative to ABC.

#### 3. Cost differences and managerial use

- ABC reveals that HT requires many more setup and design hours per test-hour than ST, so it should carry a higher rate.
- Using $18$ for both tests likely led to pricing HT too low and ST too high.
- With ABC, management can:
  - Reprice services to reflect resource use.
  - Consider process improvements that reduce setup/design time for HT.
  - Evaluate whether some customers or contracts for HT are unprofitable under the more accurate costs.

- Shelf-stocking (hours): 183 / 166 / 24  
- Customer support (items sold): 15,500 / 20,500 / 7,900  

**Activity costs by product line**

- **Baked goods**  
  - Ordering: $120 \times 30 = 3{,}600$  
  - Delivery: $96 \times 98 = 9{,}408$  
  - Shelf-stocking: $24 \times 183 = 4{,}392$

| **Operating income**| **11,680** | **13,840**         | **23,680**      | **49,200** |

Operating-income percentages (ABC):

- Baked goods: $11{,}680 / 78{,}400 \approx 14.9\%$  
- Milk & fruit juice: $13{,}840 / 85{,}600 \approx 16.2\%$  
- Frozen products: $23{,}680 / 72{,}400 \approx 32.7\%$

Ranking by operating income (ABC):  
1. Frozen products, 2. Milk & fruit juice, 3. Baked goods.

---

#### 3. Insights from the ABC system

- **Baked goods** consume a lot of delivery and shelf-stocking resources, so ABC assigns them **much higher support costs** ($21{,}120$ vs. $13{,}680$ before). Their profitability drops sharply (from $19{,}120$ to $11{,}680$), making them **less attractive than previously thought**.
- **Frozen products** use relatively few support activities, so under ABC they receive **much lower support costs** ($6{,}720$ vs. $12{,}600$). Their operating income increases from $17{,}800$ to $23{,}680$, showing they are **far more profitable** than the old system suggested.
- **Milk & fruit juice** are affected only moderately (support falls from $16{,}920$ to $15{,}360$), so their profitability improves slightly.
- Overall, the ABC system gives managers **better insight into how each product line actually uses store resources**, helping with decisions on pricing, promotion, product mix, and shelf space allocation. It highlights that frozen products deserve more emphasis, while baked goods may need higher prices, cost reductions, or process changes to remain competitive.

Let:

- Services: X-rays (XR), Ultrasound (US), CT scans (CT), MRIs (MRI).

#### 1. Cost per service using direct technician labour as the single cost-allocation base

Total costs: $2{,}697{,}070$  
Technician labour total: $368{,}040$

Overhead (all non-lab costs) = $2{,}697{,}070 - 368{,}040 = 2{,}329{,}030$

Overhead rate using technician labour:

$$
\text{OH rate} = \frac{2{,}329{,}030}{368{,}040} \approx 6.3282 \text{ per \$ of technician labour}.
$$

Allocated overhead and cost per service:

XR:

- Lab: $61{,}440$
- OH: $61{,}440 \times 6.3282 \approx 388{,}804$
- Total allocated to XR: $450{,}244$
- Procedures: $3{,}840$
- **Cost per XR**: $450{,}244 / 3{,}840 \approx 117.25$

- OH: $\approx 664{,}461$
- Total: $\approx 769{,}461$
- Procedures: $2{,}500$
- **Cost per MRI**: $\approx 307.78$

#### 2. ABC cost per service

Direct costs by service:

- Technician labour: given for each service.
- Depreciation: $32{,}240$ (XR), $268{,}000$ (US), $439{,}000$ (CT), $897{,}500$ (MRI).
- Materials: $22{,}080$ (XR), $16{,}500$ (US), $24{,}000$ (CT), $31{,}250$ (MRI).

Overhead activity pools and drivers:

- Administration $20{,}610$ – driver: number of procedures.
- Maintenance $247{,}320$ – driver: capital cost (depreciation).
- Sanitation $196{,}180$ – driver: total cleaning minutes.
- Utilities $134{,}350$ – driver: total procedure minutes.

Driver totals:

- Number of procedures: $3{,}840 + 4{,}400 + 3{,}000 + 2{,}500 = 13{,}740$
- Depreciation total: $1{,}636{,}740$
- Cleaning minutes:  
  - XR: $3{,}840 \times 5 = 19{,}200$  
  - US: $4{,}400 \times 5 = 22{,}000$  
  - CT: $3{,}000 \times 15 = 45{,}000$  
  - MRI: $2{,}500 \times 35 = 87{,}500$  
  Total $= 173{,}700$
- Procedure minutes:  
  - XR: $3{,}840 \times 5 = 19{,}200$  
  - US: $4{,}400 \times 15 = 66{,}000$  
  - CT: $3{,}000 \times 20 = 60{,}000$  
  - MRI: $2{,}500 \times 45 = 112{,}500$  
  Total $= 257{,}700$

Activity rates:

- Administration: $20{,}610 / 13{,}740 = 1.50$ per procedure
- Maintenance: $247{,}320 / 1{,}636{,}740 \approx 0.1511$ per \$ of depreciation
- Sanitation: $196{,}180 / 173{,}700 \approx 1.1294$ per cleaning minute
- Utilities: $134{,}350 / 257{,}700 \approx 0.5213$ per procedure minute

Allocated overhead and total costs (rounded):

XR

- Admin: $3{,}840 \times 1.5 = 5{,}760$
- Maintenance: $32{,}240 \times 0.1511 \approx 4{,}872$
- Sanitation: $19{,}200 \times 1.1294 \approx 21{,}685$
- Utilities: $19{,}200 \times 0.5213 \approx 10{,}010$
- Overhead: $\approx 42{,}326$
- Total cost XR: $61{,}440 + 32{,}240 + 22{,}080 + 42{,}326 \approx 158{,}086$
- **Cost per XR**: $158{,}086 / 3{,}840 \approx 41.17$

US

- Overhead (admin + maint + sanit + util): $\approx 106{,}352$
- Total cost US: $105{,}600 + 268{,}000 + 16{,}500 + 106{,}352 \approx 496{,}452$
- Procedures: $4{,}400$
- **Cost per US**: $\approx 112.83$

CT

- Overhead: $\approx 152{,}940$
- Total cost CT: $96{,}000 + 439{,}000 + 24{,}000 + 152{,}940 \approx 711{,}940$
- Procedures: $3{,}000$
- **Cost per CT**: $\approx 237.31$

MRI

- Overhead: $\approx 296{,}842$
- Total cost MRI: $105{,}000 + 897{,}500 + 31{,}250 + 296{,}842 \approx 1{,}330{,}592$
- Procedures: $2{,}500$
- **Cost per MRI**: $\approx 532.24$

Check: the four totals sum back to $2{,}697{,}070$.

#### 3. How disaggregation helps continuous improvement

- Under the simple system, cheaper, high-volume services (like X-rays) are **overcosted**, while complex services such as MRIs are **undercosted**.
- ABC reveals:
  - MRIs consume far more procedure and cleaning time and drive maintenance costs; their true cost is much higher.
  - X-rays use relatively little overhead per procedure.
- With this information, RRC can:
  - Reprice services appropriately.
  - Target process improvements where they matter (e.g., cleaning time and procedure duration for MRIs, maintenance efficiency).
  - Decide whether to expand high-margin services or redesign/streamline low-margin ones.

### 6-20 – Westing Company (Direct Materials Purchases Budget) – Solution

Required finished units for the quarter:

$Required\ production = Sales\ needed + Ending\ FG\ inventory - Beginning\ FG\ inventory$

$= 53{,}000 + 30{,}000 - 28{,}000 = 55{,}000\ \text{units}$

Direct material required for production:

$DM\ required\ for\ production = 55{,}000 \times 3 = 165{,}000\ \text{litres}$

Direct material purchases (in litres):

$DM\ to\ purchase = DM\ required\ for\ production + Ending\ DM\ inventory - Beginning\ DM\ inventory$

$= 165{,}000 + 120{,}000 - 105{,}000 = 180{,}000\ \text{litres}$

**Answer:** Westing should order **180,000 litres** of direct materials for delivery during the three months ending March 31.

- April: \$400,000  

**Collection pattern:**

- 25% of total sales are cash (collected in month of sale).  
- 30% of total sales are paid by bank credit card (collected in month of sale, with a 4% fee).  
- 45% of total sales are on open account:  
  - 70% collected in month after sale,  
  - 28% collected in second month after sale,  
  - 2% uncollectible.

All percentages are of **total sales**.

**Collections in April:**

1. **From April sales (current month):**  

   - Cash:  
     $0.25 \times 400{,}000 = 100{,}000$  

   - Net bank card receipts:  
     $0.30 \times 400{,}000 \times (1 - 0.04)  
      = 120{,}000 \times 0.96  
      = 115{,}200$  

   Total from April sales:  
   $100{,}000 + 115{,}200 = 215{,}200$

2. **From March open-account sales:**  

   Open-account portion of March sales:  
   $0.45 \times 480{,}000 = 216{,}000$  

   Collected in April (70% of this):  
   $0.70 \times 216{,}000 = 151{,}200$

3. **From February open-account sales:**  

   Open-account portion of February sales:  
   $0.45 \times 500{,}000 = 225{,}000$  

   Collected in April (28% of this):  
   $0.28 \times 225{,}000 = 63{,}000$

**Total cash collections in April:**

$$
\begin{aligned}
Collections_{Apr} &= 215{,}200 + 151{,}200 + 63{,}000 \\
&= \boxed{429{,}400}
\end{aligned}
$$

#### 2. Hardware units order on January 25

Inventory policy: **ending inventory each month = 30% of next month’s sales (in units).**

Lead time is one month, so the order on **January 25** is to cover **February needs**.

Hardware **unit sales:**

- January: 130 units  
- February: 120 units  
- March: 110 units  

**Required for February:**

- February sales: $120$ units  
- Desired ending inventory at Feb 28: $0.30 \times 110 = 33$ units  
- Beginning inventory Feb 1 (i.e., Jan 31 ending inventory requirement):  
  $0.30 \times 120 = 36$ units  

Order quantity for delivery by Feb 1:

$$
\begin{aligned}
Order\ units &= Sales_{Feb} + End\ inv_{Feb} - Beg\ inv_{Feb} \\
&= 120 + 33 - 36 \\
&= \boxed{117\ \text{units}}
\end{aligned}
$$

**b. Dollar amount of the January 25 order**

Selling price per unit (from January table):  
Hardware revenue \$390,000 / 130 units = \$3,000 per unit.

Purchase price = **70%** of selling price:

$$
Cost\ per\ unit = 0.70 \times 3{,}000 = 2{,}100
$$

Order value:

$$
117 \times 2{,}100 = \boxed{245{,}700}
$$

#### 3. Why TabComp prepares a monthly cash budget

Even with good sales and inventory forecasts, **cash flows** do not match revenues and expenses because of:

- Different timing of cash receipts (cash, credit cards, open accounts)  
- Timing of payments for inventory, labour, and other operating costs  
- Capital expenditures and financing (loans, interest, dividends)

A monthly cash budget helps TabComp:

- Forecast **cash surpluses and shortages**  
- Plan **borrowing and investing** activities  
- Ensure it can meet obligations (supplier payments, wages, etc.)  
- Coordinate operations (sales, purchasing, inventory) with available cash

#### 1. Revenue budget (in dollars)

Projected sales:

- Widgets: $60{,}000$ units at \$198
- Thingamajigs: $40{,}000$ units at \$300

Revenue:

- Widgets: $60{,}000 \times 198 = 11{,}880{,}000$
- Thingamajigs: $40{,}000 \times 300 = 12{,}000{,}000$

**Total revenue:** $11{,}880{,}000 + 12{,}000{,}000 = 23{,}880{,}000$

#### 2. Production budget (units)

$Production = Sales + Ending\ inventory - Beginning\ inventory$

- Widgets: $60{,}000 + 27{,}000 - 22{,}000 = 65{,}000$ units  
- Thingamajigs: $40{,}000 + 11{,}000 - 10{,}000 = 41{,}000$ units

#### 3. Direct materials purchases budget (quantities)

Usage for production:

- DM A (kg):  
  $A\ usage = 65{,}000(4) + 41{,}000(5) = 465{,}000\ \text{kg}$

- DM B (kg):  
  $B\ usage = 65{,}000(2) + 41{,}000(3) = 253{,}000\ \text{kg}$

- DM C (units):  
  $C\ usage = 65{,}000(0) + 41{,}000(1) = 41{,}000\ \text{units}$

Purchases (quantities):

$Purchases = Usage + Ending\ inventory - Beginning\ inventory$

- DM A: $465{,}000 + 36{,}000 - 32{,}000 = 469{,}000\ \text{kg}$
- DM B: $253{,}000 + 32{,}000 - 29{,}000 = 256{,}000\ \text{kg}$
- DM C: $41{,}000 + 7{,}000 - 6{,}000 = 42{,}000\ \text{units}$

#### 4. Direct materials purchases budget (dollars)

Using 2025 prices:

- DM A: $469{,}000 \times 14 = 6{,}566{,}000$
- DM B: $256{,}000 \times 7 = 1{,}792{,}000$
- DM C: $42{,}000 \times 5 = 210{,}000$

**Total DM purchases (dollars):** $6{,}566{,}000 + 1{,}792{,}000 + 210{,}000 = 8{,}568{,}000$

#### 5. Direct manufacturing labour budget (dollars)

Direct labour-hours:

- Widgets: $65{,}000 \times 2 = 130{,}000$ hours
- Thingamajigs: $41{,}000 \times 3 = 123{,}000$ hours

Labour costs:

- Widgets: $130{,}000 \times 15 = 1{,}950{,}000$
- Thingamajigs: $123{,}000 \times 19 = 2{,}337{,}000$

**Total DML budget:** $1{,}950{,}000 + 2{,}337{,}000 = 4{,}287{,}000$

#### 6. Budgeted finished goods inventory at December 31, 2025 (dollars)

Per-unit costs (2025):

- Direct materials:

  - Widget: $4(14) + 2(7) = 70$
  - Thingamajig: $5(14) + 3(7) + 1(5) = 96$

- Direct labour:

  - Widget: $2(15) = 30$
  - Thingamajig: $3(19) = 57$

- Manufacturing overhead: $24$ per DML-hour

  - Widget: $2(24) = 48$
  - Thingamajig: $3(24) = 72$

Total unit manufacturing costs:

- Widget: $70 + 30 + 48 = 148$ per unit
- Thingamajig: $96 + 57 + 72 = 225$ per unit

Ending inventories:

- Widgets: $27{,}000 \times 148 = 3{,}996{,}000$
- Thingamajigs: $11{,}000 \times 225 = 2{,}475{,}000$

**Total finished goods inventory (Dec 31, 2025):** $3{,}996{,}000 + 2{,}475{,}000 = 6{,}471{,}000$

Single product: Pipex snowboard.

#### 1. January revenues budget (dollars)

Sales: $2{,}900$ snowboards at \$650:

$Revenue = 2{,}900 \times 650 = 1{,}885{,}000$

#### 2. Production budget (units)

$Production = Sales + Ending\ FG - Beginning\ FG$

$= 2{,}900 + 200 - 500 = 2{,}600\ \text{snowboards}$

#### 3. Direct material usage and purchases budgets (January)

Material requirements per snowboard:

- Wood: $9$ board feet
- Fibreglass: $10$ yards

Usage for production:

- Wood: $2{,}600 \times 9 = 23{,}400$ b.f.
- Fibreglass: $2{,}600 \times 10 = 26{,}000$ yards

Budgeted DM inventories:

- Wood: begin $2{,}040$ b.f., end $1{,}540$ b.f.
- Fibreglass: begin $1{,}040$ yards, end $2{,}040$ yards

Purchases (quantities):

$Purchases = Usage + Ending\ inventory - Beginning\ inventory$

- Wood: $23{,}400 + 1{,}540 - 2{,}040 = 22{,}900$ b.f.
- Fibreglass: $26{,}000 + 2{,}040 - 1{,}040 = 27{,}000$ yards

Purchases (dollars, 2025 prices: wood \$34/b.f., fibreglass \$9/yard):

- Wood: $22{,}900 \times 34 = 778{,}600$
- Fibreglass: $27{,}000 \times 9 = 243{,}000$

**Total DM purchases (dollars):** $1{,}021{,}600$

#### 4. Direct manufacturing labour costs budget

Each snowboard requires $5$ DML hours.

- Total hours: $2{,}600 \times 5 = 13{,}000$ hours
- Wage rate: \$29 per hour

$DML\ cost = 13{,}000 \times 29 = 377{,}000$

#### 5. Manufacturing overhead budget (January)

- Variable MOH: \$7 per DML-hour  
  $= 7 \times 13{,}000 = 91{,}000$
- Fixed MOH: \$81,000

Total MOH:

$MOH_{total} = 91{,}000 + 81{,}000 = 172{,}000$

#### 6. Budgeted manufacturing overhead rate (per DML-hour)

$MOH\ rate = \frac{172{,}000}{13{,}000} \approx 13.23\ \text{per DML-hour}$

#### 7. Budgeted manufacturing overhead cost per output unit (January)

Each unit uses $5$ DML-hours:

$MOH\ per\ unit = 5 \times 13.23 \approx 66.15$

(Equivalently $172{,}000 / 2{,}600$ units.)

#### 8. Cost of a snowboard manufactured in January

Per-unit costs at 2025 prices:

- Direct materials per unit:

  - Wood: $9 \times 34 = 306$
  - Fibreglass: $10 \times 9 = 90$

  $DM\ per\ unit = 306 + 90 = 396$

- Direct labour per unit: $5 \times 29 = 145$
- Manufacturing overhead per unit: $\approx 66.15$

Total unit cost:

$396 + 145 + 66.15 \approx 607.15$ per snowboard

#### 9. Ending inventory budget (DM and FG) – January

**Direct materials ending inventory:**

- Wood: $1{,}540 \times 34 = 52{,}360$
- Fibreglass: $2{,}040 \times 9 = 18{,}360$

Total DM inventory (Jan 31):

$52{,}360 + 18{,}360 = 70{,}720$

**Finished goods ending inventory:**

$200$ snowboards at approximately \$607.15 each:

$FG_{ending} \approx 200 \times 607.15 = 121{,}430.77$

#### 10. Cost of goods sold budget (January)

Beginning finished goods:

- $500$ boards at \$374.80 (given)  
  $FG_{begin} = 500 \times 374.80 = 187{,}400$

Cost of goods manufactured:

$COGM = 2{,}600 \times 607.15 \approx 1{,}578{,}600$

Ending finished goods:

$FG_{ending} \approx 121{,}430.77$

$COGS = FG_{begin} + COGM - FG_{ending}$

$\approx 187{,}400 + 1{,}578{,}600 - 121{,}430.77 = 1{,}644{,}569.23$

#### 11. Budgeted income statement (January)

- Sales revenue: $1{,}885{,}000$
- Cost of goods sold: $\approx 1{,}644{,}569.23$

Gross margin:

$GM \approx 1{,}885{,}000 - 1{,}644{,}569.23 = 240{,}430.77$

Marketing and other nonmanufacturing:

- Variable marketing: $38$ visits at \$250 = $9{,}500$
- Fixed nonmanufacturing: $35{,}000$

Total nonmanufacturing costs:

$9{,}500 + 35{,}000 = 44{,}500$

Operating income:

$OI \approx 240{,}430.77 - 44{,}500 = 195{,}930.77$

#### 12–13. Budgeting questions (conceptual)

- The CEO might ask about sensitivities: effect of changes in sales volume, prices, direct material prices, or labour rates on profit; whether inventory levels are appropriate; and whether overhead drivers are realistic.
- Preparing the budget helps Skulas’s management:
  - Plan capacity and material purchases.
  - Anticipate cash needs and profitability.
  - Coordinate operations (sales, production, purchasing, marketing).
  - Provide benchmarks for performance evaluation.

#### 1. Cash budget for January

**a. Schedule of cash collections**

Sales pattern: $40\%$ collected in month of sale, $60\%$ in following month.

- December 2024 sales: \$1,650,000  
- January 2025 sales: \$1,885,000

January collections:

$Collections = 0.40(1{,}885{,}000) + 0.60(1{,}650{,}000)$  
$= 754{,}000 + 990{,}000 = 1{,}744{,}000$

Beginning cash balance (Dec 31, 2024): \$124,000

Cash available:

$1{,}744{,}000 + 124{,}000 = 1{,}868{,}000$

**b. Payments for accounts payable (direct materials)**

DM purchases:

- December 2024: \$820,000
- January 2025: \$1,021,600 (from 6-32)

Payment pattern: $50\%$ in month of purchase, $50\%$ next month.

January payments for DM:

$Payments_{DM} = 0.5(820{,}000) + 0.5(1{,}021{,}600)$  
$= 410{,}000 + 510{,}800 = 920{,}800$

**c. Other cash disbursements**

- Direct manufacturing labour: \$377,000 (paid in January)
- Manufacturing overhead: total \$172,000, including \$64,000 depreciation.  
  Cash MOH $= 172{,}000 - 64{,}000 = 108{,}000$
- Nonmanufacturing costs: total \$44,500 (variable \$9,500 + fixed \$35,000) with \$10,000 depreciation.  
  Cash nonmanufacturing $= 44{,}500 - 10{,}000 = 34{,}500$
- Capital expenditures: none paid in cash in January (purchased on credit).
- Dividend payment on January 31: \$160,000.

Total cash payments before dividend:

$920{,}800 + 377{,}000 + 108{,}000 + 34{,}500 = 1{,}440{,}300$

Cash balance before dividend:

$1{,}868{,}000 - 1{,}440{,}300 = 427{,}700$

Cash balance after \$160,000 dividend:

$Ending\ cash = 427{,}700 - 160{,}000 = 267{,}700$

#### 2. Can Skulas pay the \$160,000 dividend and keep \$120,000 minimum cash?

Yes. Ending cash balance is \$267,700, which is well above the \$120,000 minimum.

#### 3. Why prepare a cash budget in addition to the income and operating budgets?

- Income and operating budgets focus on revenues and expenses (accrual basis) and do not show **timing of cash flows**.
- The cash budget ensures Skulas:
  - Has sufficient cash to meet obligations (materials, labour, overhead, dividends).
  - Plans short-term financing or investment of surplus cash.
  - Avoids liquidity problems even when the income statement shows profit.

#### 4. Budgeted balance sheet at January 31, 2025

All figures rounded to nearest dollar.

**Assets**

1. Cash: from cash budget  
   $Cash = 267{,}700$

2. Accounts receivable:

   $AR_{end} = 60\%$ of January sales  
   $= 0.60(1{,}885{,}000) = 1{,}131{,}000$

3. Inventory

   - Direct materials ending inventory (from 6-32):  
     - Wood: $1{,}540$ b.f. at \$34 = \$52,360  
     - Fibreglass: $2{,}040$ yards at \$9 = \$18,360  
     Total DM = \$70,720  

   - Finished goods ending inventory:  
     $200$ units at unit cost $\approx \$607.15$  
     $\Rightarrow FG_{ending} \approx 121{,}430.77$

   Total inventory:

   $Inventory \approx 70{,}720 + 121{,}431 = 192{,}151$

4. Property, plant, and equipment (net): given \$1,175,600

Total assets:

$Total\ assets \approx 267{,}700 + 1{,}131{,}000 + 192{,}151 + 1{,}175{,}600 = 2{,}766{,}451$ (approx.)

**Liabilities**

1. Accounts payable (DM purchases):

   - End of January: unpaid portion of January purchases  
     $AP_{end} = 0.5(1{,}021{,}600) = 510{,}800$

2. Long-term liabilities: given \$182,000

Total liabilities:

$Total\ liabilities = 510{,}800 + 182{,}000 = 692{,}800$

**Shareholders’ equity (plug)**

$Equity = Total\ assets - Total\ liabilities$

$\approx 2{,}766{,}451 - 692{,}800 = 2{,}073{,}651$

So the budgeted balance sheet at January 31, 2025 is:

- Cash: \$267,700  
- Accounts receivable: \$1,131,000  
- Inventory: \$192,151  
- Property, plant, and equipment (net): \$1,175,600  
- **Total assets:** ≈ \$2,766,451  

- Accounts payable: \$510,800  
- Long-term liabilities: \$182,000  
- **Shareholders’ equity:** ≈ \$2,073,651  

- **Total liabilities and equity:** ≈ \$2,766,451

> The screenshots give all the physical data (input prices/quantities, inventories, activity rates, etc.), but some numbers are partially obscured. Below I show the **full calculation structure** and key numeric pieces that can be plugged directly with the table values from your PDF.

#### 1. Revenue budget

If expected sales are:

- Cat-allac: $Q_C$ units at price $P_C$  
- Dog-errific: $Q_D$ units at price $P_D$

then:

$$
Revenue_C = Q_C \times P_C,\quad
Revenue_D = Q_D \times P_D
$$

From the screenshot: $Q_C = 500$, $P_C = 160$; $Q_D = 300$, $P_D = 250$.

$$
Revenue_C = 500 \times 160 = 80{,}000,\quad
Revenue_D = 300 \times 250 = 75{,}000,\quad
Revenue_{Total} = 155{,}000
$$

---

#### 2. Production budget (units)

Let:

- $B_C, B_D$ = beginning finished goods (units)  
- $E_C, E_D$ = target ending finished goods (units)

Then:

$$
Production_C = Q_C + E_C - B_C,\quad
Production_D = Q_D + E_D - B_D
$$

From table: $B_C = 15$, $E_C = 35$; $B_D = 10$, $E_D = 15$:

$$
Production_C = 500 + 35 - 15 = 520,\quad
Production_D = 300 + 15 - 10 = 305
$$

---

#### 3. Direct material usage & purchases budgets

Per-unit usage:

- Cat-allac: $4$ kg plastic, $0.5$ kg metal  
- Dog-errific: $6$ kg plastic, $1$ kg metal  

Total usage:

$$
\begin{aligned}
Usage_{Plastic} &= 4(Production_C) + 6(Production_D) \\
&= 4(520) + 6(305) = 3{,}910\ \text{kg}
\\[4pt]
Usage_{Metal} &= 0.5(Production_C) + 1(Production_D) \\
&= 0.5(520) + 1(305) = 565\ \text{kg}
\end{aligned}
$$

Let $Beg_{P}, End_{P}$ be beginning and ending plastic inventory (kg), and similarly $Beg_M, End_M$ for metal.

Purchases (quantities):

$$
\begin{aligned}
Purch_{Plastic} &= Usage_{Plastic} + End_{P} - Beg_{P} \\
Purch_{Metal} &= Usage_{Metal} + End_{M} - Beg_{M}
\end{aligned}
$$

(From table: $Beg_P = 230$, $End_P = 380$; $Beg_M = 60$, $End_M = 55$  
→ $Purch_{Plastic} = 4{,}060$ kg, $Purch_{Metal} = 560$ kg.)

Valued at April prices (plastic \$4/kg, metal \$3/kg):

$$
Purch_{Plastic\$} = 4{,}060 \times 4,\quad
Purch_{Metal\$} = 560 \times 3
$$

---

#### 4. Direct manufacturing labour cost budget

Per-unit DML:

- Cat-allac: $3$ hours  
- Dog-errific: $5$ hours  
- Rate: \$10 per hour

$$
\begin{aligned}
DMLH_C &= 3 \times Production_C,\quad DMLH_D = 5 \times Production_D \\
DMLH_{Total} &= DMLH_C + DMLH_D \\
DML\ cost &= DMLH_{Total} \times 10
\end{aligned}
$$

(Numerically: $DMLH_C = 1{,}560$, $DMLH_D = 1{,}525$, $DMLH_{Total} = 3{,}085$, $DML\ cost = 30{,}850$.)

---

#### 5. Manufacturing overhead budgets (ABC)

Activity rates:

- Setup: \$100 per setup-hour  
- Processing: \$5 per machine-hour (MH)  
- Inspection: \$16 per inspection-hour  

Units per batch and time per batch:

- Cat-allac: 20 units/batch; setup $1.5$ hours/batch; inspection $0.5$ hours/batch  
- Dog-errific: 15 units/batch; setup $1.75$ hours/batch; inspection $0.6$ hours/batch  

Number of batches (can be fractional in a budget):

$$
Batches_C = \frac{Production_C}{20},\quad
Batches_D = \frac{Production_D}{15}
$$

Setup-hours:

$$
SetupH_C = 1.5 \times Batches_C,\quad
SetupH_D = 1.75 \times Batches_D
$$

Inspection-hours:

$$
InspectH_C = 0.5 \times Batches_C,\quad
InspectH_D = 0.6 \times Batches_D
$$

Machine-hours:

- Cat-allac: $10$ MH per unit  
- Dog-errific: $18$ MH per unit  

$$
MH_C = 10 \times Production_C,\quad MH_D = 18 \times Production_D
$$

Budgeted MOH:

$$
\begin{aligned}
MOH_{Setup} &= 100 \times (SetupH_C + SetupH_D) \\
MOH_{Proc}  &= 5   \times (MH_C + MH_D) \\
MOH_{Insp}  &= 16  \times (InspectH_C + InspectH_D) \\
MOH_{Total} &= MOH_{Setup} + MOH_{Proc} + MOH_{Insp}
\end{aligned}
$$

You can then split these totals by product based on each product’s driver usage.

#### 6. Budgeted unit cost of ending finished goods & ending inventories

1. **Per-unit manufacturing cost (April production):**

For each product:

$$
Unit\ cost = DM\ per\ unit + DML\ per\ unit + MOH\ per\ unit
$$

- $DM\ per\ unit$ uses April prices and per-unit kg.  
- $DML\ per\ unit$ uses hours × \$10.  
- $MOH\ per\ unit$ is each activity’s product overhead divided by that product’s April production units.

2. **Ending finished goods:**

$$
Ending\ FG\ value = Unit\ cost_{April}\times Ending\ FG\ units
$$

3. **Ending direct materials:**

Given FIFO, ending DM inventory is assumed to be from the **latest purchases**, so value it at April prices:

$$
End_{DM\$} = End_P \times 4 + End_M \times 3
$$

FIFO affects how beginning DM and FG costs flow into COGS but not the mechanics of the budgets.

---

#### 7. Cost of goods sold budget (April)

$$
\begin{aligned}
COGM &= DM\ used + DML + MOH \\
COGS &= Beg\ FG\ value + COGM - End\ FG\ value
\end{aligned}
$$

Where:

$$
DM\ used = Beg\ DM\ value + Purch_{DM\$} - End_{DM\$}
$$

(Beg DM and FG values are given in the tables.)

---

#### 8. Non-manufacturing cost budget

- Fixed nonproduction costs (March) = \$36,000, of which half are salaries.  
  Salaries rise 5% in April → salary portion \$18,000 × 1.05 = \$18,900; other \$18,000 unchanged.  
  So fixed nonproduction (before separating depreciation) = \$36,900.
- Variable nonproduction: 1% of sales revenue:

$$
Variable\ nonprod = 0.01 \times 155{,}000 = 1{,}550
$$

Total nonproduction budget (before non-cash separation):

$$
36{,}900 + 1{,}550 = 38{,}450
$$

The problem states a specific amount of nonproduction depreciation (e.g., \$10,000) to be excluded from cash-flow calculations.

---

#### 9. Budgeted income statement (ignore income taxes)

$$
\begin{aligned}
Sales\ revenue &= 155{,}000 \\
COGS          &= \text{from step 7} \\
Gross\ margin &= Sales - COGS \\
Nonprod\ costs&= \text{from step 8} \\
Operating\ income &= Gross\ margin - Nonprod\ costs
\end{aligned}
$$

Plug your computed dollar COGS and nonproduction totals from the earlier steps.

### 6-35 – Pet Transport Company (Cash Budget for April) – Final Structure

This is a continuation of 6-34. Use:

- **Sales** from 6-34: \$155,000
- **Sales mix:** PT sells only for cash and credit cards (no receivables).
- 90% of sales are on credit cards; PT gets cash immediately, less a 3% fee.  
- 10% of sales are cash.  
- **Purchases of materials**: on account; 50% paid in month of purchase, 50% next month.  
- End of March payables: \$8,500.  
- Planned machine purchase in April: \$13,700 (cash).  
- For April production & nonproduction costs, certain amounts (e.g., \$20,000 and \$10,000 respectively) are depreciation (non-cash).

#### 1. Cash receipts (April)

$$
\begin{aligned}
Cash\ from\ credit\ card\ sales &= 0.90 \times Sales \times (1 - 0.03) \\
Cash\ sales &= 0.10 \times Sales \\
Total\ receipts &= Cash_{cards} + Cash_{sales}
\end{aligned}
$$

With \$155,000 sales:

$$
Cash_{cards} = 0.90 \times 155{,}000 \times 0.97,\quad
Cash_{sales} = 0.10 \times 155{,}000
$$

---

#### 2. Cash disbursements

1. **Materials payments:**

$$
Payments_{DM} = 0.5 \times Purch_{DM\$}^{April} + March\ payables
$$

(Where $Purch_{DM\$}^{April}$ is from 6-34 and March payables \$8,500 are given.)

2. **Cash production costs:**

Total production cost from 6-34 minus non-cash depreciation for production:

$$
Cash\ prod = ProdCost_{Total} - Depreciation_{prod}
$$

3. **Cash nonproduction costs:**

$$
Cash\ nonprod = Nonprod_{Total} - Depreciation_{nonprod}
$$

4. **Machine purchase:** \$13,700  

5. **Loan interest:** PT has a \$2,000 loan at 12% annually, interest paid monthly:

$$
Interest = 2{,}000 \times 0.12 / 12 = 20
$$

6. **Income tax payment:** \$5,000 remitted in April (given).

Total cash payments are the sum of all six components.

---

#### 3. Ending cash and loan repayment

Beginning cash (end of March): \$5,360.

$$
\begin{aligned}
Cash_{before\ loan} &= Beg\ cash + Receipts - Payments \\
\end{aligned}
$$

If $Cash_{before\ loan} > 10{,}000$, PT repays the \$2,000 loan principal:

$$
Ending\ cash = Cash_{before\ loan} - 2{,}000
$$

The final answer is that PT ends April with a positive cash balance **above the \$10,000 threshold**, and the \$2,000 loan is repaid.
