# Purchasing

#### Objectives of Purchasing

To the best possible conditions
> meaning required quantity and quality to the lowest prices etc

#### Purchasing Functions

selecting right specifications from right supplier
> quality, quantity, time, place, source and price

Then issue administering purchase orders

#### Purchasing Cycle

1. Clarify Requisitions (receive and analyse)
2. Look for supplier
3. Determine price
4. Purchase Order
5. Monitor delivery process
6. Receive Delivery
7. Approve Payment if correct delivery arrived

#### Establishing Specifications

establish requirements to make "best buy"

Requirements include:
	- Quantity
	- Price
	- Functional
	- Environmental 

##### Quantity

**Small volume** -> find standard item

**Large items** -> reduce cost -> must be functional 

##### Price

Depends on use and selling price of finished item

##### Functional

depends on product

*example:*
Car needs to be
	1. reliable
	2. look good
	3. safe
	4. fuel efficient

Car could also need to be:
	1. Look great
	2. safe
	3. fast

##### Environmental 

welp seems to not be important

#### Selecting Suppliers

needs to able able to:
	1. supply quantity
	2. supply on time
	3. have a good price 
	4. contribute to improvement of product

additional factors in selecting Suppliers are:
	1. Technical knowledge
	2. Manufacturing capability
	3. Reliable
	4. Service
	5. Location
	6. Price
	7. On-going relationship
	8. Mutual benefit

#### Price Determination

Direct influence on company´s profit ( 50% of CoGS)

**You only get what you paid for**

#### Price Negotiation

Buyer needs knowledge of sellers costs and have enough influence

Price Negotiations should also benefit both parties and justify time and effort

#### Impact of MRP on Purchasing

Two Categories of activity
	1. Procurement 
	2. Supplier scheduling and follow-up

*Procurement* -> specifications, selecting suppliers etc.

*Supplier scheduling* -> same as specifications, execute master schedule and ensure good use of resources

#### Buyer/Planner Concept

Production activity control
> controls flow of work in plant and controls need for components (when and where)

Purchasing
> flow of goods from suppliers

Responsible for planning and buying -> works with Master Scheduler and other Planners

Should handle fewer compontens and ensure a smoother flow of information.
> has knowledge of what factory needs and therefore matches material requirements with supplier capabilities


#### Supply Chain Management Organizational Implications

**Total Cost Focus**
	-> More then just Price -> Includes transportation, storage, etc. -> needs value stream mapping and value analysis with suppliers

Supplier and Buyer will share informations like: costs, schedules or inventory levels

Measurement system are to be put in place and used

#### Supply Chain Management Savings

More effective product specifications

Create leverage through buying-power

Lower cost through longterm relationships and contracts
